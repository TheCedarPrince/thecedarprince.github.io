<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>This is a question to clarify my understand of coproducts as I have largely spent some time in understanding what they are and how to interpret them. </p>
<h3 id="question">Question</h3>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I was hoping I could get some clarification on my understanding of coproducts as I <em>believe</em> I have finally wrapped my head around them, but I want to be clear that I do.  To understand coproducts, I started with the set theory definition of a coproduct: </p>
\[
\bigcup_{i \in I} \{(x, i): x \in A_{i}\}
\]
<p>where \(i \in I\) denotes indexing from some <em>index set</em>, \(I\), using the index term, \(i\) and \(A_{i}\) represents some <em>family of sets</em> indexed by \(i\) and \(x\) is some element of the respective \(A_{i}\) set. Then, based on readings from Category Theory texts, I have gathered that the following is equivalent notation to the formal set theory definition: \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\).  As an example to make sure I am on the right track, here is a small simple problem and its solution according to my understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\) given the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
\[
> I = \{1, 2, 3\}
> \]
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
\[
> A = \{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{2, 4, 6\}\}
> \]
<blockquote>
<p>Solution: \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i} = \{(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2)\}\)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where I am confused is the following: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the difference between \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\) and \(\coprod_{i \in I} A_{i}\) and \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2}\) syntax notation &#40;the latter notation concerns two specific sets&#41;?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have seen all notations when referring to coproducts when viewed from both set theory and category theory perspectives. Is it a matter of aesthetic or is there a functional/semantic difference occurring?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>I have read that coproducts are also known as disjoint unions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I read about disjoint unions from a set theory perspective and also a category theory perspective but cannot really discern a functional &#40;i.e. practical&#41; difference from coproducts. Are coproducts and disjoint unions really effectively the same idea?</p>
<p>Thanks all and let me know if I can clarify anywhere&#33; </p>
