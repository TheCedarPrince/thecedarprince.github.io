<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I examined this paper to learn more about vulnerabilities posed to minority and vulnerable populations. I focused less on pandemic-related risks and more on examples of problems posed to minority populations.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerable_population_examples">Vulnerable Population Examples</h3>
<p>Intersectional vulnerable populations &#40;e.g. those living with disability, poverty conditions, or racial minority, etc.&#41; face even more perils to their already vulnerable state.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>African Americans have the highest mortality from colorectal cancer. &#40;3, 4&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Diagnosed at younger ages 
- Intersectionally, African Americans who are poor, uninsured, and/or geographically isolated are less likely to get screening tests 
	- Less likely to receive treatment for advanced disease</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Hispanics or Latinos are disproportionately affected by SDOH factors. &#40;5&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Have highest incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Native American reservations lack low number of ICU hospital beds. &#40;8&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Indian Health Services only had limited ability to help COVID-19 patients.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Minorities are over-represented as and in: &#40;9&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Essential workers 
- Poor and overcrowded housing
- Could be impossible to adhere to COVID-19 safety policies</code></pre>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> An overview and summary of vulnerable populations that are particular to rural US</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##bibliography #review #vulnerable #populations #rural #us  #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>K. M. Gonzalez, &quot;A Systematic Review of the Health of Vulnerable Populations within US Rural Societies,&quot; OJRNHC, vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 112–147, 2018, doi: 10.14574/ojrnhc.v18i1.507.</p>

<h3 id="reading_movation">Reading Movation</h3>
<p>I wanted to read this paper to get more a sense for vulnerable populations. Although I was less interested in the specific applications to rural communities, I found the discussion around rural vulnerabilities very interesting as well as clarification around definitions.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_vulnerability">What Is Vulnerability?</h3>
<p>Vulnerable populations are those subgroups that are at risk for experiencing elevated healthcare disparities. &#40;De Chesnay &amp; Anderson, 2016; Shi &amp; Stevens, 2010&#41;.</p>
<p>A potential model to assess vulnerability is that proposed by &#40;Grabovschi et al., 2013&#41; where it can be visaulized as a right triangle with the horizontal axis representing healthcare accessibility and quality; vertical axis represents healthcare needs; hypotenuse is the level of vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="barriers_often_encountered_in_rural_healthcare_settings">Barriers Often Encountered in Rural Healthcare Settings</h3>
<p>Health disparities continue to be a severe problem across US populations. &#40;Crosby, Wendel, Vanderpool, &amp; Casey, 2012; Penman-Aguilar et al., 2016&#41; Trends in inequalities emerge for patients seeking healthcare across multiple factors such as race, socioeconomic status, and provider accessibility.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rural dwellers tend to lack insurance compared to urban settings &#40;Barker, Londeree, McBride, Kemper, &amp; Mueller, 2013; Soni, Hendryx, &amp; Simon, 2017&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many rural dwellers travel more than 30 minutes for healthcare - it is especially exacerbated where public transportation is lacking and severe poverty exists &#40;Warren &amp; Smalley, 2014, p. xiii&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities_most_often_studied_in_rural_health_literature">Vulnerabilities Most Often Studied in Rural Health Literature</h3>
<p>46 articles were studied for this systematic review. Population sizes ranged from 10 to 30,874 people. For quantitative studies, populations ranged from 28 to 30,874 participants.</p>

<h3 id="recommendations_for_future_research">Recommendations for Future Research</h3>
<p>Only one article calculated a power analysis &#40;Komro et al., 2015&#41;.</p>
<p>Power analysis are used in quantitative research to limit error between hypothesis and findings.</p>
<p>There was observed an overrelianceon descriptive correlational designs that impeded adequate theory testing. Studies should incorporate theories and theoretical applications relevant to rural populations.</p>
