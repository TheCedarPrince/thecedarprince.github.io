<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>This is a question to clarify my understand of coproducts as I have largely spent some time in understanding what they are and how to interpret them. </p>
<h3 id="question">Question</h3>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I was hoping I could get some clarification on my understanding of coproducts as I <em>believe</em> I have finally wrapped my head around them, but I want to be clear that I do.  To understand coproducts, I started with the set theory definition of a coproduct: </p>
\[
\bigcup_{i \in I} \{(x, i): x \in A_{i}\}
\]
<p>where \(i \in I\) denotes indexing from some <em>index set</em>, \(I\), using the index term, \(i\) and \(A_{i}\) represents some <em>family of sets</em> indexed by \(i\) and \(x\) is some element of the respective \(A_{i}\) set. Then, based on readings from Category Theory texts, I have gathered that the following is equivalent notation to the formal set theory definition: \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\).  As an example to make sure I am on the right track, here is a small simple problem and its solution according to my understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\) given the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
\[
> I = \{1, 2, 3\}
> \]
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
\[
> A = \{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{2, 4, 6\}\}
> \]
<blockquote>
<p>Solution: \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i} = \{(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2)\}\)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where I am confused is the following: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the difference between \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\) and \(\coprod_{i \in I} A_{i}\) and \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2}\) syntax notation &#40;the latter notation concerns two specific sets&#41;?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have seen all notations when referring to coproducts when viewed from both set theory and category theory perspectives. Is it a matter of aesthetic or is there a functional/semantic difference occurring?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>I have read that coproducts are also known as disjoint unions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I read about disjoint unions from a set theory perspective and also a category theory perspective but cannot really discern a functional &#40;i.e. practical&#41; difference from coproducts. Are coproducts and disjoint unions really effectively the same idea?</p>
<p>Thanks all and let me know if I can clarify anywhere&#33; </p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>To learn and understand the concept of coproducts within the context of category theory. Also, I came across the symbolic notation for what disjoint unions are and wanted to understand what the notation fully meant.</p>
<h3 id="disjoint_union_of_sets_intuition">Disjoint Union of Sets Intuition</h3>
<p>To build an intuitive sense of what a disjoint union is, consider the following.</p>
<p>Given two sets, \(X = \{a, b, c, d\}\), \(Y = \{1, 2, 3\}\), the coproduct of these sets would be: </p>
\[
X \coprod Y := \{a, b, c, d, 1, 2, 3\}
\]
<p>This also is referred to as the &quot;disjoint union of sets&quot;. Although, it is important to note that an important aspect of this notation above is missing from the coproduct which will be explained in the section on a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/#coproduct-of-a-set-and-itself">coproduct of a set and itself</a>.</p>
<h3 id="coproduct_of_a_set_and_itself">Coproduct of a Set and Itself</h3>
<p>If given set \(X = \{a, b, c, d\}\), the coproduct of \(X\) and itself would look like this:</p>
\[
X \coprod X \cong \{i_{1}a, i_{1}b, i_{1}c, i_{1}d, i_{2}a, i_{2}b, i_{2}c, i_{2}d\}
\]
<p>In this case, \(i_{1}\) and \(i_{2}\) are unique inclusion functions that map each set in a coproduct to its disjoint union. The inclusion functions in my opinion, act as a sort of metadata that helps one know where elements of a disjoint union comes from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: The author, David Spivak, in <em>Category Theory for the Sciences</em> presented the above notation for a coproduct of \(X\) and itself.  Personally, I found this notation very confusing and feel the formal set theory definition explained in the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/#set-theory-definition">section on the set theory definition of a coproduct</a> to be more useful here.  If we revisited the operation \(X \coprod X\), I am more inclined to write the problem and solution as follows:</p>
<p>Let \(X = X_{1} = X_{2}\), the value of \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2}\) is: \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2} \cong \{(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 1), (d, 1), (a, 2), (b, 2), (c, 3), (d, 4)\}\)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="set_theory_definition">Set Theory Definition</h3>
<p>This big honking formulation is the formal set theoretic definition of a coproduct:</p>
\[
\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i} = \bigcup_{i \in I} \{(x, i): x \in A_{i}\}
\]
<p>What this says loosely is that given a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/09302022033236-family-sets.md">family of sets</a> \(A\) indexed by the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/09302022040126-indexed-sets.md">index set \(I\)</a>, a coproduct is a set that enumerates every element in \(A_{i}\) with its associated set. Referencing the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/#coproduct-of-a-set-and-itself">example on a coproduct of a set and itself</a>:</p>
<p>Given: \(X = \{a, b, c, d\}\)</p>
<p>Let \(X = X_{1} = X_{2}\), the value of \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2}\) is: </p>
\[
X_{1} \coprod X_{2} \cong \{(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 1), (d, 1), (a, 2), (b, 2), (c, 3), (d, 4)\}
\]
<p>The coproduct is a set which enumerates every element in both set \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) as a tuple with an associated index to say what set this element originated from &#40;i.e. \((a, 1)\) is the same \(a\) from set \(X_{1}\)&#41;.</p>
<h3 id="notation_in_category_theory">Notation in Category Theory</h3>
<p>It is important to make clear that in category theory, these two syntaxes are seen:</p>
\[
\coprod_{i \in I} X_{i}
\]
<p>and \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_{i}\)</p>
<p>Both refer to a disjoint union and both can be read as &quot;the disjoint union of the family of sets \(X_{i}\) indexed by the index set, \(I\).&quot; Here, when we say <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//09302022033236-family-sets.md">&quot;family of sets&quot;, they can either be a &quot;set of subsets over a set \(X\)&quot; or a &quot;set of sets \(X\) where each set could be independent of one another.&quot;</a></p>
