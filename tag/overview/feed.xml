<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I first came across this paradox within high school history courses. It never left my mind as I found it such a bizarre and counter-intuitive result that had great implications when trying to help or improve situations. In a way, it has been a guiding principle in my life to think through interventions.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When technological progress or government policy increases efficiency of resource usage, but the falling cost of this resource results in increases of its usage, rather than a reduction. bauerBookReviewPerspectives2009?, yorkUnderstandingJevonsParadox2016?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put more plainly, the paradox emerges when you improve the efficiency of a resource to decrease its use but instead, the improved efficiency increases the demand of the resource.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>The most canonical example comes from environmental economics wherein a city with a vehicle traffic problem wants to reduce traffic in their city. To remedy this problem, they think that increasing the number of lanes in their main city highway will reduce traffic. So, they build additional lanes. But rather than improve traffic, traffic becomes even worse as a result of more people wanting to drive through the city. schneiderCityLabUniversityInduced2018?</p>
<p>Where Jevons first observed this was in the mid-1800&#39;s. He saw that when James Watt created a steam engine that greatly improved the efficiency of coal-ran steam engines, it made using coal very cost effective. As a result, Jevons observed that the use of coal, rather than staying the same or going down, increased as people wanted to use coal more often. jevonsCoalQuestionInquiry1866? Thus, the inception of Jevons Paradox. </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> An overview of the RDF and how it works</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> #rdf #overview #triplet #graph #framework #archive</p>

<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>What Are RDF Triplets?</li><li>What Are Examples of RDF Triplets?</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>The Resource Description Framework &#40;RDF&#41; is a family of specifications created by the World Wide Web Consortium &#40;W3C&#41; and formally adopted by W3C in 1999. Data mapped into the RDF form into triplets called <em>RDF statements</em> &#40;also known as Semantic Triplets&#41;.</p>
<h3 id="what_are_rdf_triplets">What Are RDF Triplets?</h3>
<p>These triplets, or statements, are comprised of three components called the <em>subject</em>, the <em>predicate</em>, and the <em>object</em>. In summary, these components are described as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Subject</strong> - this denotes a resource where anything can be a resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is synonymous with the idea of an entity in other data models.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Predicate</strong> - traits or aspects of a defined resource and expresses the relationship between a <strong>Subject</strong> or a given <strong>Object</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Object</strong> - the target of the predicate and is similar to a resource in that anything can be an <strong>Object</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What the RDF statement compactly communicates is that there holds some relationship, indicated by the predicate, between the <strong>Subject</strong> and <strong>Object</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what_are_examples_of_rdf_triplets">What Are Examples of RDF Triplets?</h3>
<p>Example RDF statements are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The sky is colored blue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Grass is colored green.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The ocean is colored blue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking the statement &quot;The sky is colored blue.&quot; the <strong>Subject</strong> is the phrase &quot;sky&quot;, the <strong>Predicate</strong> is the verb phrase &quot;is colored&quot;, and the <strong>Object</strong> is the final phrase, &quot;blue&quot;. Moving forward from this example, it may be useful to think of the RDF statement as a labeled directed multigraph where components of the statement are typically broken down and stored in Relational Database Management Systems or native RDF file storage formats. Here is a way of visualizing the triplet for the given statements above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LRsky --is colored--&gt; blue
ocean --is colored--&gt; blue
grass --is colored--&gt; green</code></pre>
<p>The RDF triples &quot;The sky is colored blue.&quot;, &quot;Grass is colored green.&quot;, and &quot;The ocean is colored blue&quot; can all be represented as a Directed Multigraph \(G\). The nodes \(sky\), \(ocean\), and \(grass\) are <strong>Subjects</strong>, the nodes \(blue\) and \(green\) are <strong>Objects</strong>, and the edge \(is colored\) is the <strong>Predicate</strong> in these RDF triple.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A note that provides an overview to intensive care unit scoring systems</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##overview #intensive #care #unit #rating #scoring #prediction #quality #care #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>A. Rapsang and D. C. Shyam, &quot;Scoring systems in the intensive care unit: A compendium,&quot; Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine, vol. 18, no. 4, pp. 220–228, Apr. 2014, doi: 10.4103/0972-5229.130573.</p>

<p>This paper was useful as it provided a good overview of intensive care unit scoring systems. It enumerated their characteristics and also talked about their advantages. The paper also went over a variety of scoring systems but as I was concerned with learning what scoring systems in general were, I stopped there.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_a_scoring_system">What is a Scoring System?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is one approach clinical staff in an intensive care unit utilize to predict patient outcomes <em>and</em> to improve clinical decisions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, intensive care unit scoring systems&#33;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is an intensive care unit scoring system?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These scoring systems &#40;also referred to as severity scales&#41; are calculated alongside traditional diagnosis methods. They are used to: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Predict patient outcomes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compare quality of care</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create breakdowns for clinical trials</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They are handy for also analyzing unexpected patient outcomes and what precipitated the outcome.</p>
<h3 id="what_characterizes_a_scoring_system">What Characterizes a Scoring System?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a scoring system comprised of?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A scoring system generally has two components:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Score - a number assigned to a given disease based on severity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Probability Model - determines the probability of patient deaths.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>How are scoring system probability models used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, a model gives clinical decision makers additional insight into comparing patient populations for:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Treatment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Triage</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comparative analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Understanding treatment effectiveness</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimizing resources</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what_are_characteristics_of_an_ideal_model">What Are Characteristics of an Ideal Model?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the three characteristics of an ideal model for scoring?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ideal model must be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Valid</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calibrated</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discriminated</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean for a model to have &quot;validity&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Validity&quot; means how well a model performs on test datasets during the model&#39;s creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does a &quot;calibrated&quot; model mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accuracy between estimated mortality probabilities and the actual mortalities experienced by patients. What is key to note is that it is also able to be statistically robust/rigorous. &#91;1&#93; Essentially, is the model well suited to the actual patients being evaluated?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does a model that is &quot;discriminatory&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How well the model can determine what patients live and what patients die in practice. Examples of measures used to understand discriminatory patterns in a model are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sensitivity</p>
</li>
<li><p>Specificity</p>
</li>
<li><p>False positive rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>False negative rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Positive predictive power</p>
</li>
<li><p>Misclassification rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concordance. &#91;2&#93;</p>
</li>
</ul>
