<p>G. P. Guy et al., &quot;Association of State-Issued Mask Mandates and Allowing On-Premises Restaurant Dining with County-Level COVID-19 Case and Death Growth Rates — United States, March 1–December 31, 2020,&quot; MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep., vol. 70, no. 10, pp. 350–354, Mar. 2021, doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm7010e3.</p>

<h3 id="definitions_and_background">Definitions and Background</h3>
<p><strong>State-issued mask mandates:</strong> Required to wear masks at:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>Businesses and food establishments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>State-issued restaurant closures:</strong> Restaurants not operating or restricting service to takeout, curbside pickup, or delivery. </p>
<p><strong>Providing indoor or outdoor on-premises dining:</strong> State lifting a restaurant closure. No distinction was made on how restaurants reopened &#40;such as with reduced capacity, enhanced sanitation, etc.&#41;. Per states, if a bar served food, it was coded as a restaurant and if a bar did not serve food, there were bars.</p>
<h3 id="equations">Equations</h3>
<p>&#40;1&#41; Daily growth rate : </p>
\[
\ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - \ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - 1 * 100
\]
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>Analyses were weighted by county population; standard errors were robust to heteroscedasticity; clustered by state. </p>
<p>Relationship between policies and COVID-19 measured 1–20 days prior to implementation compared with seven mutually exclusive time ranges post-implementation. Associations were examined 60 - 41 and 40 - 21 days before implementation and 1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days after implementation.</p>
<p>COVID-19 case and death growth rates were compared via weighted least-squares regression with county and day fixed effects. Four regression models were used for associating mandates and COVID-19 growth rates by controlling for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restaurant closures in mask mandate models</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mask mandates in the restaurant reopening models</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bar closures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay-at-home orders</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bans on gatherings of &gt;&#61; 10 persons</p>
</li>
<li><p>Daily COVID-19 tests per 100000 persons</p>
</li>
<li><p>County</p>
</li>
<li><p>Day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QUESTION: I wonder how they controlled for these covariate variables?</em></p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates over these day ranges post-mask mandate implementation were seen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Permitting on-premises dining saw increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates</p>
<ul>
<li><p>41 - 60</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>days after reopening.</p>
<p>Increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates were observed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>days after reopening.</p>
<p>During March 1–December 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied in 2,313 &#40;73.6&#37;&#41; of the 3,142 U.S. counties. Post mask mandate COVID case growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20 days: -0.5&#37; &#40;p &#61; 0.02&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40 days: -1.1&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60 days: -1.5&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80 days: -1.7&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 -100 days: -1.8&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Post mask mandate COVID death growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20 days: -0.7&#37; &#40;p &#61; 0.03&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40 days: -1.0&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60 days: -1.4&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80 days: -1.6&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 -100 days: -1.9&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QUESTION: Oh so does this suggest that it took about 20 days before we started to see the lagging effects of these mandates?</em></p>
<p>After &gt; 40 days on-premises dining was permitted, increases in case and death growth rates were observed. Possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restaurants may have delayed reopening after on-premises dining allowed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restaurant patrons cautious at reopen but grew bolder as time passed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Models not control for other policies like: other types of business closures, physical distancing recommendations, policies issued by localities, and county-level policy variances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Policy compliance and enforcement not explored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No differentiating indoor and outdoor dining, ventilation, and following physical distancing and occupancy not investigated.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="study_purpose">Study Purpose</h3>
<p>Examined whether implementation of statewide mask mandates was associated with COVID-19–associated hospitalization growth rates among different age groups.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Statewide mask mandate:</strong> persons operating in a personal capacity must wear a mask</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>At businesses and in restaurants &amp; food establishments</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>COVID-NET Site:</strong> Group of counties within a state. Sites in states that did not have statewide mask mandates during March 1– October 17, 2020, were excluded from the analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Nonpharmaceutical Interventions &#40;NPIs&#41;:</strong> Actions taken to slow the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<h3 id="data_source">Data Source</h3>
<p><strong>COVID-NET:</strong> population-based surveillance system &#91;1&#93; that provides laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in 99 counties located in 14 states, beginning March 1, 2020 &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>For analyses, cumulative hospitalization rates for each week of the study period for seven age cohorts &#40;adults aged 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years&#41; were aggregated into three age groups &#40;18–39, 40–64, and ≥65 years&#41;.</p>
<p>Weekly cumulative hospitalization growth rate &#40;HGrowthast&#41; for age cohort a in site s during week t is defined as the weekly percentage change in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 persons, estimated by HGrowth<em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; &#40;&#40;log &#40;HR</em>&#123;ast&#125;&#41;-log &#40;HR<em>&#123;as&#40;t-1&#41;&#125;&#41;&#41;×100, where HR</em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population for age cohort a in site s in week t. The log of the cumulative hospitalization growth rate is similar to the log of the cumulative cases per week, as the denominators are equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>For 40-64 year-olds, 2 weeks after statewide mask mandates: weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 2.9&#37;.</p>
<p>For 40-64, 18 - 39 year-olds, &gt;&#61; 3 weeks after statewide mask mandates: weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 5.5&#37;.</p>
<p><em>QUESTION: How were these age groupings made I wonder?</em></p>
