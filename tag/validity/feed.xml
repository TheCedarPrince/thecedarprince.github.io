<p>Reduction of non-response bias through the introduction of new weighting techniques. &#91;1&#93; <em>QUESTION: What is non-response bias and how do you adjust for that?</em></p>
<h3 id="how_reliability_and_validity_were_measured">How Reliability and Validity Were Measured</h3>
<p>High reliable papers included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conducted reliability tests using repeated test/retest measures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Used multiple samples/populations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Used multiple time periods.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ran statistical tests</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How authors achieved higher validity by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Comparing BRFSS to physical measures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Self-report on chronic conditions between BRFSS and surveys are highly reliable.</p>
<p>As time between conducting the same survey lapses, reliability for some questions decrease when re-asked. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Sometimes, self-reports from the BRFSS were very reliable but prevalence differed. <em>QUESTION: What does it mean when self-reports are highly reliable and prevalence rates still differ? Seems really strange and I am not sure why this would happen...</em></p>
<p>Similarities between BRFSS and other surveys using self-reports persisted across different modes of reporting like phone calls or in-person interviews. Researchers observed BRFSS reliability and validity for some cohorts but not for others. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>All surveys consistently showed the proportion of respondents indicating general health to be &quot;excellent&quot; was declining. <em>RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY</em></p>
<p>BRFSS physical activity measures and responses were compared sometimes to physical device measures.Prevalence variation estimates found occasionally; trends similar when comparing survey results over time. <em>QUESTION: Interesting how with devices prevalences did vary but trends were found to be similar across demographics. I wonder what reports did that? I&#39;ll stick a pin in this for now.</em></p>
