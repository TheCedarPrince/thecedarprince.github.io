<p>An overview of how telehealth interventions could and should be deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Really excellent read in my opinion that goes beyond just the COVID-19 pandemic but rather can be taken and applied elsewhere in the telehealth landscape. In particular, their conclusions were interesting as well as their discussion on clinician unwillingness.</p>

<li><p>Structure care models to incorporate telehealth as a core foundation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Communicate to all stakeholders the best mode that they will receive</p>
</li>
<li><p>Incorporate routine evaluation and management of telehealth interventions</p>

<p>G. P. Guy et al., &quot;Association of State-Issued Mask Mandates and Allowing On-Premises Restaurant Dining with County-Level COVID-19 Case and Death Growth Rates — United States, March 1–December 31, 2020,&quot; MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep., vol. 70, no. 10, pp. 350–354, Mar. 2021, doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm7010e3.</p>

<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Definitions and Background</li><li>Equations</li><li>Methods</li><li>Results</li><li>Limitations</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="definitions_and_background">Definitions and Background</h3>
<p><strong>State-issued mask mandates:</strong> Required to wear masks at:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>Businesses and food establishments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>State-issued restaurant closures:</strong> Restaurants not operating or restricting service to takeout, curbside pickup, or delivery. </p>
<p><strong>Providing indoor or outdoor on-premises dining:</strong> State lifting a restaurant closure. No distinction was made on how restaurants reopened &#40;such as with reduced capacity, enhanced sanitation, etc.&#41;. Per states, if a bar served food, it was coded as a restaurant and if a bar did not serve food, there were bars.</p>
<h3 id="equations">Equations</h3>
<p>&#40;1&#41; Daily growth rate : </p>
\[
\ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - \ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - 1 * 100
\]
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>Analyses were weighted by county population; standard errors were robust to heteroscedasticity; clustered by state. </p>
<p>Relationship between policies and COVID-19 measured 1–20 days prior to implementation compared with seven mutually exclusive time ranges post-implementation. Associations were examined 60 - 41 and 40 - 21 days before implementation and 1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days after implementation.</p>
<p>COVID-19 case and death growth rates were compared via weighted least-squares regression with county and day fixed effects. Four regression models were used for associating mandates and COVID-19 growth rates by controlling for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restaurant closures in mask mandate models</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mask mandates in the restaurant reopening models</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bar closures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay-at-home orders</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bans on gatherings of &gt;&#61; 10 persons</p>
</li>
<li><p>Daily COVID-19 tests per 100000 persons</p>
</li>
<li><p>County</p>
</li>
<li><p>Day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QUESTION: I wonder how they controlled for these covariate variables?</em></p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates over these day ranges post-mask mandate implementation were seen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Permitting on-premises dining saw increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates</p>
<ul>
<li><p>41 - 60</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>days after reopening.</p>
<p>Increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates were observed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>days after reopening.</p>
<p>During March 1–December 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied in 2,313 &#40;73.6&#37;&#41; of the 3,142 U.S. counties. Post mask mandate COVID case growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20 days: -0.5&#37; &#40;p &#61; 0.02&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40 days: -1.1&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60 days: -1.5&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80 days: -1.7&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 -100 days: -1.8&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Post mask mandate COVID death growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20 days: -0.7&#37; &#40;p &#61; 0.03&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40 days: -1.0&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60 days: -1.4&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80 days: -1.6&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 -100 days: -1.9&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QUESTION: Oh so does this suggest that it took about 20 days before we started to see the lagging effects of these mandates?</em></p>
<p>After &gt; 40 days on-premises dining was permitted, increases in case and death growth rates were observed. Possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restaurants may have delayed reopening after on-premises dining allowed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restaurant patrons cautious at reopen but grew bolder as time passed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Models not control for other policies like: other types of business closures, physical distancing recommendations, policies issued by localities, and county-level policy variances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Policy compliance and enforcement not explored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No differentiating indoor and outdoor dining, ventilation, and following physical distancing and occupancy not investigated.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="study_purpose">Study Purpose</h3>
<p>Examined whether implementation of statewide mask mandates was associated with COVID-19–associated hospitalization growth rates among different age groups.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Statewide mask mandate:</strong> persons operating in a personal capacity must wear a mask</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>At businesses and in restaurants &amp; food establishments</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>COVID-NET Site:</strong> Group of counties within a state. Sites in states that did not have statewide mask mandates during March 1– October 17, 2020, were excluded from the analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Nonpharmaceutical Interventions &#40;NPIs&#41;:</strong> Actions taken to slow the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<h3 id="data_source">Data Source</h3>
<p><strong>COVID-NET:</strong> population-based surveillance system &#91;1&#93; that provides laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in 99 counties located in 14 states, beginning March 1, 2020 &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>For analyses, cumulative hospitalization rates for each week of the study period for seven age cohorts &#40;adults aged 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years&#41; were aggregated into three age groups &#40;18–39, 40–64, and ≥65 years&#41;.</p>
<p>Weekly cumulative hospitalization growth rate &#40;HGrowthast&#41; for age cohort a in site s during week t is defined as the weekly percentage change in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 persons, estimated by HGrowth<em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; &#40;&#40;log &#40;HR</em>&#123;ast&#125;&#41;-log &#40;HR<em>&#123;as&#40;t-1&#41;&#125;&#41;&#41;×100, where HR</em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population for age cohort a in site s in week t.

<p>Changes in population movement based on stay-at-home orders between March 1–May 31, 2020 given by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories were examined.</p>
<h4 id="classifying_stay-at-home_orders">Classifying Stay-at-Home Orders</h4>
<p>Coding of orders was based solely on the legal language in each state or territorial order. Stay-at-home orders were assigned a mutually exclusive category based on this language:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All required &#40;language examples: persons &quot;shall,&quot; &quot;must,&quot; or &quot;are directed to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Applied to persons in specific jurisdictions&#39; locations &#40;language examples: persons &quot;shall,&quot; &quot;must,&quot; or &quot;are directed to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Required for individuals &gt; 65 years or with underlying conditions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mandatory for individuals &gt; 65 years or with underlying conditions in specific jurisdictions&#39; locations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not required but advised to stay home &#40;language examples: persons &quot;should,&quot; &quot;are encouraged to,&quot; or &quot;are urged to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jurisdictions that did not issue an order were coded as having no state- or territory-issued order</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="determining_time_windows">Determining Time Windows</h4>
<p>Given a state &quot;s&quot; that issues a stay-at-home order at date &quot;t&quot;, pre- and post-order windows for each county, &quot;c&quot;, in a state can be defined. c&#39;s preorder window contains movement values, m, during the time period before, t. The postorder window contains m values during the time period after t. Each county&#39;s preorder window serves as a county- and COVID-specific baseline. Small time values observed during these periods reflect county-specific invariants and impacts of the pandemic on behavior in the absence of state- or territory-issued community mitigation policies. ***QUESTION:** What is a sufficiently small value of n-days &#40;or time period before and after t&#41;?* ***QUESTION:** What is a county-specific invariant?*</p>
<p>Order index date types:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each jurisdiction&#39;s counties</p>
</li>
<li><p>Waning or end of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each jurisdiction&#39;s counties</p>
</li>
<li><p>Date of the first state stay-at-home order</p>
</li>
<li><p>Date of the first termination of a state stay-at-home order</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="analyzing_for_changes_in_population_movement_patterns">Analyzing for Changes in Population Movement Patterns</h4>
<p>Counties were broken into rural-urban categories to ensure groupings of counties with similar population sizes. Box plots were constructed for each category to examine the distribution of county mean percentages of devices at home during the pre- and postorder periods associated with each index date. Movement values following a normal distribution was not assumed for all counties and periods.  A clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test was then performed, with counties as clusters, on the constituent counties&#39; median pre- and post-order values associated with each index date. A lower-tailed test was used for dates regarding the start of regional mandates. An upper-tailed test was used for dates recording the end of regional mandates. Strata-level statistical significance was assessed at the 99&#37; confidence level &#40;alpha &#61; 0.01&#41;. <em>Dataset used: <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/documentation/">The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s Rural-Urban Continuum Codes</a> are used to stratify counties in this analysis</em> <strong>QUESTION:</strong> What is a &quot;clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test&quot;?_</p>
<p>Population movement was inferred via the percentage of individual devices reported each day that were home for each county. A 7-day rolling average was used to smooth each county&#39;s pre- and postorder time series values ***QUESTION:** I wonder how good a metric this observation serves as a proxy of measuring population movement?*</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<h4 id="general_insights">General Insights</h4>
<p>Regions which issued stay-at-home mandates saw general declines in population movement. At the same time as the first state relaxed their mandate, regions that had not relaxed their mandates saw increased population movement. Stay-at-home orders can reduce activities associated with community spread of COVID-19. This includes population movement and external person-to-person contact.</p>
<h4 id="limitations_of_this_analysis">Limitations of this analysis</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Device coverage correlates with US pop density.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, certain regions or groups might be inequitably represented. ***QUESTION:** How does relative device coverage largely correlate with US pop density?*</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>People may have multiple mobile devices and might take any number of them when they leave home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test is used with counties as clusters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is because a county&#39;s median pre- and postorder values are paired comparisons. Possible spatial dependence between counties wasn&#39;t addressed.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>The report does not account for nationwide protests affects on mobility patterns.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The only relationship analyzed was between stay-at-home orders and population movement.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="general_insights">General Insights</h3>
<p>This study provides a template for understanding large economic shocks as they happen to counter the problem of data availability during major economic shocks. The start of the pandemic saw an unprecedented decline in economic activity in the US. The largest single month decline in US unemployment was 14 percent in April 2020.</p>
<p>The federal government&#39;s response totalled to nearly three trillion dollars spent to counter pandemic effects. Their response comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Economic Impact Payments &#40;tax rebates&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Small business loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Massive increase in unemployment insurance as part of the CARES Act</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methods_of_research">Methods of Research</h3>
<p>Basic Monthly Current Population Survey &#40;Monthly CPS&#41;, was used due to its quick release to understand the impact of macroeconomic conditions and government policies on US families&#39; incomes.</p>
<p>Family income from respondents in their first or fifth month in the survey were observed for a monthly sample ranging from 8,999 households and 20,822 individuals in February 2020 to 6,149 households and 14,383 individuals in April 2020.  Monthly CPS data from IPUMS-CPS &#91;1&#93; Generally, 90&#37; of earnings are reported in CPS, as opposed to ~60&#37; of unemployment insurance. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="key_conclusions">Key Conclusions</h3>
<p>Without US government intervention, poverty would have risen by 2.7 percentage points between January and June.</p>
<p>The COVID Impact survey &#91;3&#93; finds an increase in food insecurity when compared to a different earlier survey while the Census Bureau&#39;s Household Pulse survey &#91;4&#93; finds high rates of inability to pay rent.  These sources suggest increased hardship after the pandemic. The increase in deprivation is not due to the overall income loss, but rather due to other disruptions of the pandemic, including possibly the unevenness of the income flows.</p>
<p>Disruptions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Closures of schools</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stores</p>
</li>
<li><p>Churches and other facilities</p>
</li>
<li><p>The uncertainty about future income streams</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concerns about the health of family and friends</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other disruptions</p>
</li>
</ul>
