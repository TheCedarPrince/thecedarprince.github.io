<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I sometimes find myself wanting to execute a Julia file I have just edited.  This is different than what the excellent <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl">Revise.jl package &#40;created by Tim Holy&#41;</a> does in that I want to execute the full file and not just update function definitions. Moreover, I may just want Julia to do something else entirely upon updating a file or directory. This can be very helpful in analysis workflows as well as literate programming. Creating an extended post on my process for this was inspired by a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://discourse.julialang.org/t/franklin-jl-automatically-evaluate-jl-file-on-change/92580/6">Julia Discourse post I provided an answer to</a>.</p>
<h3 id="set-up">Set-Up</h3>
<p>Here is how I recommend setting up your Julia environment to follow this tutorial &#40;I assume you have Julia installed correctly&#41;:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create an empty directory &#40;folder&#41; somewhere on your computer. &#40;NOTE: For sake of this tutorial, I will refer to it as the &quot;test&quot; folder&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Within your favorite text editor &#40;like Notepad, Vim, VSCode, etc.&#41;, open this directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open and create a file called &quot;tmp.jmd&quot; &#40;NOTE: Keep the file and your editor open as we will be coming back to this file quite a lot&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open your Julia REPL within the directory and activate a temporary environment within package mode:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">pkg&gt; activate --temp</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Add into this temporary environment the following packages:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">pkg&gt; add FileWatching, Weave</code></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li><p>Install node onto your machine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I suggest using the great tool, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"><code>nvm</code>, which allows easy management of node versions</a>.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><p>Install the node package, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync"><code>browser-sync</code>, which allows for syncing of webpages based on updates</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the command you can use in your command line: </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm i -g browser-sync</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Steps 6 and 7 are not necessary if you are not interested in the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/#asynchronous-workflow-for-literate-programming">section on literate programming</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="simple_workflow_process">Simple Workflow Process</h3>
<p>There are two ways to start this workflow.  One blocking &#40;i.e. you cannot use the Julia REPL while working&#41; and another spawning an asynchronous background process to enable you to work with the same REPL. Here is gif showing these workflows in action:</p>
<p><img src="../assets/01082023043553-watching-example.gif" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="blocking_workflow">Blocking Workflow</h4>
<p>This creates a synchronous task in your Julia REPL that can then run whatever command you want while you monitor a specific file &#40;or folder&#41;. In this case, I am making the task print a statement that says “Change Detected&#33;” to my REPL whenever there is a change in the file called “tmp.jmd”.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">using FileWatchingwhile true 
    watch_file&#40;&quot;./tmp.jmd&quot;&#41;
    println&#40;&quot;Change Detected&#33;&quot;&#41;
end</code></pre>
<p>This workflow is not optimal as this loop continues and locks your REPL from doing anything else. </p>
<h4 id="asynchronous_workflow">Asynchronous Workflow</h4>
<p>This creates an asynchronous task in the background of your Julia REPL that can then run whatever command you want while you monitor a specific file &#40;or folder&#41;. In this case, I am making the task print a statement that says “Change Detected&#33;” to my REPL whenever there is a change in the file called “tmp.jmd”.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">using FileWatching@async while true 
    watch_file&#40;&quot;./tmp.jmd&quot;&#41;
    println&#40;&quot;Change Detected&#33;&quot;&#41;
end</code></pre>
<p>From here, you could then still interact with this REPL while this task is running in the background. Furthermore, you can change the line that says <code>println&#40;&quot;Change Detected&#33;&quot;&#41;</code> to whatever command &#40;or commands&#41; you want to trigger.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous_workflow_for_literate_programming">Asynchronous Workflow for Literate Programming</h3>
<p>This workflow allows one to work with a Julia Markdown document with <code>Weave.jl</code> to preview your work in real time.  There a few steps to start the workflow but here is how it looks when in operation:</p>
<p><img src="../assets/01082023043553-weave-example.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>First, execute the following snippet in your Julia REPL to start the asynchronous process to watch for changes and tell Julia to weave the file we will modify:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">using FileWatching
using Weave@async while true 
    watch_file&#40;&quot;./tmp.jmd&quot;&#41;
    weave&#40;&quot;./tmp.jmd&quot;&#41;
end</code></pre>
<p>Next, run this in a separate terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">browser-sync start --server --start --file &quot;./*.html&quot;</code></pre>
<p>or this command within your Julia REPL &#40;NOTE: This will make your REPL session very cluttered but you can still use your REPL&#41;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">@async run&#40;&#96;browser-sync start --server --start --file &quot;./*.html&quot;&#96;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you should see <code>browser-sync</code> spit out a lot of information that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">&#91;Browsersync&#93; Access URLs:
 --------------------------------------
       Local: http://localhost:3000
    External: http://192.168.1.186:3000
 --------------------------------------
          UI: http://localhost:3001
 UI External: http://localhost:3001
 --------------------------------------
&#91;Browsersync&#93; Serving files from: ./</code></pre>
<p>You&#39;ll want to grab that URL that looks like <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in the <code>Local</code> spot and then open that in your web browser.  With the URL that you get &#40;it could be on a different port&#41;, navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/tmp.html</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, when you have this all in place, go ahead and add this code block into the <code>tmp.jmd</code> file that was created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Hello World This is a Julia Markdown file. &#96;&#96;&#96;julia 
2 &#43; 2
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre>
<p>You should see a few things happen.  You&#39;ll see a few messages from the Julia REPL stating that <code>Weave.jl</code> is weaving your document to your desired output. Then, you&#39;ll see <code>browser-sync</code> say something about updating or syncing.  Finally, you will see your browser update to the latest version of your weaved document. </p>
<p>Feel free to play around with this more and see the dynamism of the workflow&#33; I tend to do this when I am iteratively developing reports within Julia and want to tinker within the REPL at the same time I am creating documents. Having to wait for rendering <code>Weave.jl</code> documents and the like was a pain and this took the pain away.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope you appreciated this post&#33; If you have any suggestions, comments, or additional workflows this could be used for, please comment below.  May your Julia sessions now be even more supercharged&#33;</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I have always found graph theory interesting ever since I was exposed to it back in my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech. I found out about it through SIR Modeling but personally found the structure of graphs far more fascinating than its application to SIR models. Furthermore, as I intend to be pursuing graduate studies in applied mathematics, why not get started with trying to understand it?</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This book has had an immense impact in the world of science. From how science is taught to how science is thought about, Kuhn&#39;s notions of scientific revolution resonated across nearly all domains of science as well as touching into the arts. The central conceit that Kuhn stated in this book is that the scientific community knows what the world is like. I was recommended this book by my friend, collaborator, and Category Theorist, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.jpfairbanks.com/">Professor James P. Fairbanks</a> I can see why it was recommended as it fits in quite nicely to the ensuing philosophical ideas found in <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11082021041951-category-theory-scientists.md">Category Theory</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_normal_science">What Is <em>Normal Science</em>?</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022044134-normal-science.md">Note for atomic concept</a></p>
<p>According to Kuhn, <em>normal science</em>, is research based on past scientific accomplishments that are considered the foundation for that area of investigation. Generally, this is the area where most scientists spend their time. The research done in normal science can be theoretical or empirical.</p>
<p>In the book, Kuhn referred to this as &quot;mop-up work&quot; and that this mopping up or &quot;filling out&quot; of science is what most scientists do. Although language such as &quot;mop-up&quot; work can make one think that Kuhn was being pejorative to these so-called &quot;scut scientists&quot;, he did not intend it so. In later versions of this book, he made a response to this point of confusion and clarified that this work still is fascinating and crucial in many ways to the advancement of science.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_characteristics_of_normal_science">What Are the Characteristics of Normal Science?</h4>
<p>An important aspect of normal science is that it does not engage with or seek out anything new. The invention of theories, development of new phenomena - anything abnormal - is not part of normal science. Novelty is abhorrent and antithetical to normal science.</p>
<p>Aside from this fundamental aspect of normal science, Kuhn posited that there are three general areas of research in normal science. He emphasized that they do not always hold or are always discrete from one another:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Investigating questions around the fundamental facts found in a specific domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Questions that are predicted and expected to have answers existing within an already existing research domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Further articulating the fundamental facts held in a given domain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what_was_kuhns_concept_of_a_paradigm">What Was Kuhn&#39;s Concept of a Paradigm?</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022044626-kuhnian-paradigm.md">Note for atomic concept</a></p>
<p>Kuhn reintroduced into the modern English lexicon the word, &quot;paradigm&quot;. Before his time, the term was rather archaic. A paradigm is the background through which normal science is conducted loosely speaking. Another way of thinking about it is from online user <em>heynonnynonnie</em> suggesting that a paradigm is a consensus agreed upon by a group of practitioners of a field.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_characteristics_of_a_paradigm">What Are the Characteristics of a Paradigm?</h4>
<p>When he used the word, as Kuhn admitted himself, he overloaded the term to mean quite a number of things. To my understanding, this was my gist of a Kuhnian paradigm in that paradigms generally have two core characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Unprecedented and can sustain practitioners</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open-ended and with problems to be solved or investigated</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Endemic to paradigms is that they posit theories around a domain of research. For a paradigm to be accepted, it must propose a better theory than its predecessors or competitors. Furthermore, a proposed new paradigm is not required to address every fact of the world.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_benefits_of_choosing_a_paradigm">What Are the Benefits of Choosing a Paradigm?</h4>
<p>When a domain decides upon a paradigm, avenues of research can now be readily scoped. By presupposing paradigm, questions can now be posed within the context of the paradigm. In accordance to the paradigm, it can be reasonably assumed that solutions can be found.</p>
<p>A benefit that did not immediately appear to me was the insulating properties of a paradigm. An example that Kuhn suggested is that in the social sciences, one has to frame an avenue of research by its importance to society &#40;such as studying racial discrimination, etc.&#41;. Problems such as these are notoriously difficult to frame and reach a quorum consensus on due to possibly many competing schools of thought or groups. Instead, by keeping a conversation limited to the adherents of a specific paradigm, a researcher can easily keep moving forward through problems without having to strive against competing schools of thought. Furthermore, the insulating power of a paradigms gives a researcher the ability to solely focus on problems they think they can solve or are solvable.</p>
<p>I will admit, his example of social scientists was at first confusing. But, upon reflection, what made this example make sense is that he later explained his decision to have this as an example due to the fact that there are often many competing paradigms in these areas. This conflict makes progress difficult as many people still argue the fundamentals of these sciences.</p>
<h3 id="what_causes_the_downfall_of_a_paradigm">What Causes the Downfall of a Paradigm?</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022044910-downfall-kuhnian-paradigm.md">Note on atomic concept</a></p>
<p>Normal science certainly is clear, safe, and predictable. But, what if a scientist finds results that do not fit within a paradigm? What if a result, ruling out all possible errors carried forth by a highly scrupulous researcher, is simply unexplainable - an anomaly against the backdrop of a paradigm? To Kuhn, this marks an important inflection point in adopted paradigms.</p>
<p>Novelty in science only emerges with resistance and difficulty because any, as Kuhn wisely points out, researchers who investigate every anomaly will not get much done. But at some point, these anomalies will continue to accumulate to the point of being unignorable to adherents of a paradigm. A sort of malcontent will arise adherents and to <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07222020181007-famous-quotes.md">quote Sherlock Holmes, &quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot;</a> And that truth is that an accepted paradigm is no longer sufficient to explain a domain which leads to a period of significant upheaval.</p>
<p>Kuhn characterized the downfall of a paradigm in three generic ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Awareness of anomaly</p>
</li>
<li><p>Further recognition of awareness</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contested possible change or challenge to the existing paradigm</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what_happens_when_a_paradigm_is_in_crisis">What Happens When a Paradigm Is in Crisis?</h4>
<p>When the anomalies are fully unconscionable, they are finally acknowledged and, to quote Kuhn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Discovery commences with &#91;...&#93; awareness of anomaly&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous paradigm prepared an adherent on how to detect an anomaly and in a way, set up its own downfall. At this stage of upheaval, many will attempt to explain or address the anomalous behavior. A new era of discovery in the face of a failing paradigm marks this interstitial period of an outdated paradigm where many speculative and unarticulated theories abound - often at odds with one another in some way. The previous paradigm&#39;s rules become hazy and the rules of normal research begin to veer away from its typical, standard process.</p>
<h4 id="extraordinary_problems">Extraordinary Problems</h4>
<p>This problem leads normal science into a rather interesting process of science called &quot;extraordinary science&quot;. Extraordinary science is an offshoot of normal science that exists when a paradigm is in crisis and to address the paradigm in crisis. It is the science that either repairs, questions, or proves the deficiency of an existing paradigm. Important to note about extraordinary science is that they are never known at the outset of a paradigm but only after advanced normal research in the context of a given paradigm.</p>
<h3 id="scientific_revolutions_and_the_term_revolution">&quot;Scientific Revolutions&quot; and the Term &quot;Revolution&quot;</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022045723-scientific-revolutions.md">Note on atomic concept</a></p>
<p>According to Kuhn, these crises are the requirements for a new paradigm to come forth. This leads to extraordinary science as this episode in a paradigm&#39;s life is extraordinary that causes a basic shift in how science is even conducted. This period, coined by Kuhn, is called a &quot;Scientific Revolution&quot;.</p>
<p>Kuhn was very particular in invoking the term &quot;revolution&quot;. He related the phrase &quot;scientific revolution&quot; analogously to a political revolution. In the same way that a political revolution is often fomented when a political body fails to serve adequately the growing body of its populace, so too are the grounds set for a scientific revolution.</p>
<p>Although a paradigm may shift how one does science, the world itself does not change. Rather, the way we view and operate in the world does. For the adoptees of a new paradigm, the adoptee must say something to the effect of &quot;I once understood X to be Y, but I was mistaken&quot; and in doing so admit a form of error in looking at reality.</p>
<h3 id="invoking_new_paradigms_on_faith">Invoking New Paradigms on Faith</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022045931-new-paradigms.md">Note on atomic concept</a></p>
<p>A problem inherit to the development of new paradigms is that to adopt these new paradigms is most certainly an act of faith. Early adherents to a new paradigm must stand against the onslaught of problems that were solved or addressed by  a previous paradigm. They must simply have hope and faith that this new paradigm they have adopted will succeed in the areas where the previous paradigm failed. As Kuhn said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A decision of that kind can only be made on faith&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when this new paradigm is able to successfully surmount longstanding problems, Kuhn says that even still a vast majority of scientists will be apprehensive to adopt this paradigm. Why? Kuhn observed that two conditions must be met for further adoption:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The new paradigm must solve outstanding problems that the prior paradigm could not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Much of the problem solving tools from previous paradigms should still be able to be used in this new paradigm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this sense, there is a type of verification or vetting of a new paradigm – an analogy to natural selection as Kuhn pointed out. For a new paradigm to be successful, not only must it address all problems hitherto encountered by prior paradigms, but be able to solve outstanding problems prior paradigms could not and the barrier to adopting this new paradigm must be minimal. &quot;No theory ever solves all &#91;...&#93; puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect,&quot; is a fitting bookend from Kuhn to remember when encountering new paradigms.</p>
<p>One small final footnote on new paradigms is an observation by Kuhn: the invention of a paradigm most generally comes from someone very young or new to the field where a paradigm exists that they are trying to change.</p>
<h3 id="on_the_non-linearity_of_science">On the Non-Linearity of Science</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022050357-non-linearity-science.md">Note on atomic concept</a></p>
<p>One thing out of this book is that I very much appreciated and agreed with Kuhn&#39;s notion that science is not linear nor is it necessarily the result of a universal truth being uncovered. Rather, it is the confluence of emerging theories that evolve and find they can fit with other theories or paradigms. These newly combined theories then come together to possibly overturn or change the understanding of currently practiced science.</p>
<p>This fallacious notion of linear knowledge going to a particular truth about the world is based in part on science historians and textbook makers. As textbooks are designed to assist students in learning as much material as possible, the teacher with the textbook maker chooses to formulate a textbook around one particular area of knowledge thereby giving a sense of progress to a domain&#39;s particular truth. As science does not deal with all possible experiments but only those which are doable according to an existing paradigm, so too a textbook must be very judicious in what it presents to a student from its paradigm.</p>
<h3 id="additional_notes">Additional Notes</h3>
<p>As I wrap up this review of <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, here are some additional notes that didn&#39;t quite fit in the overall review. I did still find these pertinent as well as helpful in expanding thoughts about paradigms.</p>
<h4 id="paradigm_shifts_in_other_domains">Paradigm Shifts in Other Domains</h4>
<p>Outside of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, Kuhn&#39;s notion of paradigm shifts do occur. Such a paradigm shift based on Kuhn&#39;s writings in an area such as the social sciences could be - and I am making an educated guess here - something akin to the near modern universal condemnation and outlawing of slavery. However, to this end Kuhn posited that unlike the other natural sciences, there still exist competing schools of thought. A visceral modern example is that social scientists also have to defend their choice of a research problem such as examining race in the context of the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07112020161337-social-determinants-health.md">social determinants of health</a> where other existing schools of thought may fiercely disagree on the validity of such endeavors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kuhn gave the great example that, &quot;the man who argues that philosophy &#91;...&#93; has made no progress emphasizes that there are still Aristotelians, not that Aristotelianism has failed to progress,&quot; I am in agreement with Kuhn in that it is not that schools of thought outside Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics are not making progress. It is that their are much more fundamental conflicts in these spaces that have yet to be reconciled in sufficient ways.</p>
<p>In an online group discussion, the user <em>ish-i-ness</em> furthered this idea to the arts that, &quot;that in the arts you could even say that there is a desire to discover an aesthetic truth, something that is indisputably, objectively beautiful and thought provoking, rather than just a fad that is only interesting because it’s appeals to a particular, subjective set of preferences.&quot; Here, <em>ish-i-ness</em> invokes this notion of aesthetic truth which is associated with Theodore Adorno.</p>
<h4 id="non-kuhnian_revolutions_or_domain_transformations">Non-Kuhnian Revolutions or Domain Transformations</h4>
<p>In an online group discussion, the user <em>heynonnynonnie</em>, made a great point that non-Kuhnian scientific revolutions happen more frequently than the bigger Kuhnian scientific revolutions &#40;such as the heliocentric versus geocentric theory, etc.&#41;. As these are much smaller scale revolutions and do not affect the entirety of science, I call these &quot;domain transformations&quot; as they transform or affect a particular domain&#39;s way of operating but not the rest of science as a whole. <em>heynonnynonnie</em> gave the example that the discovery of the DNA structure, though fantastic and a major discovery, provided only pure information that fit within the preexisting paradigms.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I thought this book was well done and also worth this lengthy analysis. It provided context to a lot of ideas that were born from the notions Kuhn coined here. For me, it felt like giving me a bit more of a better foundation to understand better how to operate in domains. Even if this piece is labeled more as a philosophy of science piece, it could easily also be considered a sociological exploration of academia as a whole. I recommend the read, but also, not to take the notions as literally or seriously as possible. Kuhn himself suggested that as he later would get inundated with letters saying that there was a revolution happening because of X - help me. As judicious as Kuhn was in using the term revolution, we too must be careful to recognize when a revolution or paradigm shift is occurring.</p>

<p><em>A living note on my faith as a Christian</em></p>
<p>Saying you are a Christian is a loaded statement that colors a spectrum. It brings to mind the halls of a quiet countryside monastery echoing with billowing hymns to outraged shouts of damnation from a pulpit. Saying you are a Christian is strangely all encompassing and hollow simultaneously.</p>
<p>I am a Christian and this blog post is an overview of what <em>I</em> mean by that.</p>
<p>My faith as a Christian affects every aspect of my life as I view God as the Lord of All. I mean &quot;Lord of All&quot; as I view God is omniscient over what exists and what will be. He is the master programmer, the master engineer, the master author, the master – . And as a result of that, I view Him as the one source of knowledge and guidance.</p>
<p>I do not mean that one can learn everything from the Bible. There is no book in the Bible that contains Kepler&#39;s Laws of Planetary Motion or the Central Limit Theorem.  Rather, God communicates a framework through His Word, the Bible, that proves sufficient for every domain and has given us minds and bodies to go and explore His created world.</p>
<p>By God, it is my understanding that there are definite &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; absolutes set forth by a good and righteous God. A result of this I must address is the sad stereotype that unfortunately resonates all too frequently with the truth is the judgemental behavior found in Christian circles. This often has a cultural and historical aspect on how persons view religious institutions - I do not want to discuss that.</p>
<p>Instead, I endeavor practicing the ability to disagree with but accept others. Sadly, this is a skill that is all too-lacking - amongst Christians and beyond. I am perfectly fine discussing generally anything and perhaps most importantly, disagreeing over something. This is a pattern set forth by Jesus from the beginning. Jesus was not sent to those who agreed with him but those who so fiercely opposed Him that they killed Him and still showed compassion for his murderers.</p>
<p>And most important in my faith is my acceptance and trust in the person who is Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior of the World. Saving us from what? Ourselves. As I believe there are definite &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; absolutes, it would follow that there are consequences for when we pursue &quot;wrong&quot;. And out of those consequences, the most severe is separation from God both now while we are alive and the eternity that our souls find ourselves in upon our demise.</p>
<p>And Jesus is that saving power - that bridge which brings us from that separation to eternity with God. As no one has ever done what is &quot;right&quot; except only Jesus who was both God and a person just like us. I trust that Jesus was killed around 30 CE, He was entombed for three days, resurrected proving that death has no mastery over God, and ascended to the right hand of God. In short, when Jesus said to the grieving sister Martha over the death of her brother, Lazarus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">Jesus said to her,&quot;I am the resurrection and the life. 
The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; 
and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.Do you believe this?&quot;- John 11:25 - 26</code></pre>
<p>To which I respond: &quot;yes&quot;.  There are multiple omissions of my credo that I have left out here for brevity. I have further included a copy of the Nicaean Creed which I am in full accord with that can help fill in some of those gaps, succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nicaean Creed</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. </p>
<p>I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man.</p>
<p>For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets.</p>
<p>I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To leave off, please note: I am not a perfect Christian. No one is or can be. I try to follow God with confident steps; oftentimes, it looks more like a faltering walk. Yet, by the grace of God, I have courage that each day can be better and I can show Christ&#39;s love to others not through faux perfection of arrogance but the ordinary efforts of a common man with an extraordinary Savior.</p>
<p><em>Solil Deo Gloria – To God Alone Be the Glory.</em></p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Knowledge is one of the most nebulous ideas known to mankind since nearly the beginning of time. What may be knowledge to one person may be useless noise to another - this encapsulates the difficulty in defining knowledge. As a result of its many possible meanings, I put forth a rather opinionated proposal for what I term the &quot;Open Knowledge Model&quot;.</p>
<p>The Open Knowledge Model is a standard that defines not how to maintain knowledge in what are typically coined &quot;knowledge management systems&quot;. Instead, its focus is on how to structure information that goes directly into such systems. It is fully compatible with the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.iso.org/standard/68683.html">ISO 30401</a> standard.</p>
<p>There are many different knowledge management systems available to someone – from a pen and pencil to various software offerings. Each of these offerings are very unique and accordingly offer benefits and cons. This model remains independent of any such offering but instead prescribes a model to structure information in any of the offerings one chooses to pursue.</p>
<h3 id="model_components">Model Components</h3>
<p>The model is composed of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Title Block</strong> - this is a unique block that begins with the name of the note followed by three required subcomponents:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- **Date** - the date the note was created
- **Summary** - a brief, single sentence summary of what this note is about
- **Keywords** - keywords that can be used to find or associated with the content of this note</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bibliography Block</strong> - this contains the bibliographic information that is associated with the specific note</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Notes</strong> - where one&#39;s notes go on the note subject in whatever format one so chooses</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>References</strong> - list of references used in the note</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is the core requirement of the model.  What follows are a few digressions on this model. </p>
<h3 id="digressions_and_recommendations_for_model">Digressions and Recommendations for Model</h3>
<h4 id="title_block">Title Block</h4>
<p>It is recommended that for <strong>Date</strong>, one chooses a consistent convention for how one will record the date across their knowledge base using this model.  In practice, there can be as many <strong>Keywords</strong> as one chooses, but it is often better to be more concise in what you choose as words.</p>
<h4 id="bibliography_block">Bibliography Block</h4>
<p>It can be possible that there isn&#39;t one bibliography associated with this not or none at all.  In those situations, it makes sense to perhaps write something like: &quot;Not Available&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>This is the most critical piece to any note.  One can structure and write their notes in any way they please here.  Include images, diagrams, code snippets – anything your knowledge management system supports. The model imposes no specific structure here – implementations may differ.</p>
<h4 id="references">References</h4>
<p>It is recommended to never write down the references section manually. Instead, offload this to a third party reference manager or another tool that could generate this information from a given note. </p>
<h3 id="implementation_examples">Implementation Examples</h3>
<p>To give an example of implementations, here are some examples of implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08032021134232-notes-template.md">Markdown Implementation</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tools_for_working_with_model">Tools for Working with Model</h3>
<p>Here are a list of some tools that have emerged to work with the Open Knowledge Model: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://github.com/TheCedarPrince/NoteMate">NoteMate.jl</a> - a companion for working with a knowledge management system that adheres to the Open Knowledge Model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Written in Julia and offers parsing from Markdown notes to other target formats.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This standard is an active work in progress and is the product of years of experimentation.  If you find problems with this model or believe it too restrictive or unwise, please comment in the discussion or reach out to me. My hope is that this standard will co-evolve with new tools and increase the utility of any person&#39;s knowledge management system.</p>

<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>E. Cheng, X &#43; Y: A Mathematician’s Manifesto for Rethinking Gender. Basic Books, 2020.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Introduction</li><li>Category Theory as Tool for Thinking on Gender</li><li>Congressive versus Ingressive Thinking</li><li>Conclusion</li><li>Final Thoughts</li></ol></li><li>References</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Eugenia Cheng takes a nuanced approach to the discussion around gender. As she references, some feminists&#39; battle cry is the phrase, &quot;Smash the patriarchy&#33;&quot;. In Cheng&#39;s idea of feminism, she instead looks for language that is less divisive and more inclusive encompassed in her saying, &quot;Let’s transform our world into a more congressively led future.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="category_theory_as_tool_for_thinking_on_gender">Category Theory as Tool for Thinking on Gender</h3>
<p>With this approach, she launches into her core contribution to the discussion on gender which is introducing the mathematics of <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11082021041951-category-theory-scientists.md">category theory</a> to decouple historical characteristics associated genders from the genders themselves. Cheng argues that this is a better approach to take in gender discussions to think more deeply about traits or characteristics in isolation rather than rooted in gender. You can then critique a characteristic or trait rather than a whole group of people.</p>
<p>Rather than being a book on mathematics and gender, category theory is used more as a mental model or framework to enact this decoupling. This works well as category theory fundamentally concerns itself about relationships. In her opinion, category theory enables one to think more clearly about about characteristics with a great degree of flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="congressive_versus_ingressive_thinking">Congressive versus Ingressive Thinking</h3>
<p>Cheng introduced two crucial words into her argument which can describe concepts, behaviors or people: &quot;congressive&quot; and &quot;ingressive&quot;. This is how she defined these terms summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ingressive</strong> - putting oneself over society, imposing on others frequently, far more individualistic than collaborative, less flexible thinking</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Congressive</strong> - society over self, prioritizing others, highly collective and community-focused, holistic thought patterns</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the onus of characteristics is moved from tightly coupled gender stereotypes to decoupled conversations on those characteristics in isolation. However, this isn&#39;t entirely the case all the time as most concepts, behaviors, or people have some tendencies to ingressive behavior and some to congressive behavior. As Cheng herself posits, &quot;When gender is relevant, we need to consider it. When character is relevant, we need to consider it.  But we shouldn&#39;t assume they are linked.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>She concludes in her book how she doesn&#39;t want, &quot;to see &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; character traits evaluated against each other &#91;...&#93; so only one side can win,&quot; in discussions around gender. She emphasizes how she doesn&#39;t want women having to act like men to succeed. Rather, she believes that there are not only other ways to make contributions to society but rather that there are other traditional forms of success.</p>
<h3 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this book&#33; I feel like her point was made pretty early on and I appreciated some of the examples. However, as I am acquainted with category theory as well as having read some material on gender studies in the past, I personally was able to skip through various parts.</p>
<p>I think her notion of decoupling is immensely important however I am not sure on her terminology of &quot;ingressive&quot; and &quot;congressive&quot;. Whenever anyone overloads terms with additional definitions, it makes me nervous that confusion in discussion can occur. However, since these are not commonly used terms, at least in my experience, it makes me think this may not be as big an issue.</p>
<p>Finally, it has made me think about where this method of decoupling can be used rigorously. In particular, I am curious about race and concepts such as the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07112020161337-social-determinants-health.md">social determinants of health</a> and how category theoretic approaches can be brought there. I think Cheng even teases readers with this idea so I am curious to see if she revisits the ideas someday:</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of a temporary abstraction also takes into account the thorny issue of intersectionality, and the need to take other forms of power imbalance into account besides those governed by gender, for example race, wealth, sexual orientation, and so on.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall, good read&#33;</p>

<h1>Othello</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> April 9 2022</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A review of the book Othello and some thoughts on the central conflict</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##summary ##book #play #tragedy #racism #boredeom ##blog #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>W. Shakespeare and others, &quot;Othello:&#91;1622&#93;,&quot; Oxford Text Archive Core Collection, 1991.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Racism and Deconstruction of the Noble Savage</li><li>Manipulation as Enigmatic Entertainment</li><li>Transcendental Love</li></ol></li><li>References</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="racism_and_deconstruction_of_the_noble_savage">Racism and Deconstruction of the Noble Savage</h3>
<p>It is surprisingly progressive in some ways I found - even by today&#39;s standards which was interesting. The racist overtones in the book were very much in your face but with the treatment of Othello, I did not find it similar to the idea of the &quot;noble savage&quot; literary idea but rather much different. Instead, it felt like Othello was treated by all other accounts either an equal or due to his experience, exempt from the racial overtures his peers had towards him generally.</p>
<h3 id="manipulation_as_enigmatic_entertainment">Manipulation as Enigmatic Entertainment</h3>
<p>What I enjoyed the most was this could be also retitled: &quot;Gaslighting: the Book&quot; with how the villain Iago manipulated everyone in the book. It was breathtaking the amount of animus Iago had to everyone and what stuck with me the most at the end when the character was finally caught in his schemes was that Iago didn&#39;t really have a reason. Even when Iago himself was trying to justify himself, it was very shaky at best and he knew it. I think he was just a character who knew he could be good at being very bad and enjoyed the power trip it gave him.</p>
<p>I quite liked the fact that he did not have a real motive. It drove home the pettiness of him but is not unrealistic. To me, he reminded me of a man who was very bored and his most fun was in controlling the lives of others in some way even if it meant his ruin. It has been said that the most dangerous people to watch for are those who have nothing to lose when you have every thing to lose. The think this is a very apt description of Iago as a man who has nothing but is happy to see some one lose everything.</p>
<h3 id="transcendental_love">Transcendental Love</h3>
<p>Finally, what has stuck with me is how much Othello and Desdemona were in love with each other. It was typical of Shakespeare to write these deep romances where the bonds between the lovers could transcend the times that the people were from. It is both saddening and interesting that the situation described here is not too dissimilar to the world we live in still. In the start of the book, you can see the bigotry at full display in the father of Desdemona which is eerily like modern discussions.</p>

<p>What follows is an actual note in my knowledge management system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Normal Science**Date:** May 22 2022**Summary:** An overview of what normal science is according to Thomas Kuhn.**Keywords:** #normal #science #characteristics #work #archive## BibliographyT. S. Kuhn and I. Hacking, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Fourth edition. Chicago ; London: The University of Chicago Press, 2012.## Notes### What Is &quot;Normal Science&quot;?According to Kuhn, *normal science*, is research based on past scientific accomplishments that are considered the foundation for that area of investigation. 
Generally, this is the area where most scientists spend their time. 
The research done in normal science can be theoretical or empirical.In the book, Kuhn referred to this as &quot;mop-up work&quot; and that this mopping up or &quot;filling out&quot; of science is what most scientists do.
Although language such as &quot;mop-up&quot; work can make one think that Kuhn was being pejorative to these so-called &quot;scut scientists&quot;, he did not intend it so. 
In later versions of this book, he made a response to this point of confusion and clarified that this work still is fascinating and crucial in many ways to the advancement of science.#### What Are the Characteristics of Normal Science?An important aspect of normal science is that it does not engage with or seek out anything new. 
The invention of theories, development of new phenomena - anything abnormal - is not part of normal science. 
Novelty is abhorrent and antithetical to normal science.Aside from this fundamental aspect of normal science, Kuhn posited that there are three general areas of research in normal science. 
He emphasized that they do not always hold or are always discrete from one another:1. Investigating questions around the fundamental facts found in a specific domain.
2. Questions that are predicted and expected to have answers existing within an already existing research domain.
3. Further articulating the fundamental facts held in a given domain.## References</code></pre>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> January 7 2021</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> How causality gives us tools to understand the question of cause-and-effect and confounders</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##bibliography #causality #diagrams #counterfactual #statistics #graphs ##book ##blog #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>J. Pearl and D. Mackenzie, The book of why: the new science of cause and effect, First edition. New York: Basic Books, 2018.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Benefits of Causal Analysis</li><li>Critiques of Statistics</li><li>Causal Calculus</li><li>Inference Engine</li><li>Ladder of Causality</li><li>Mini-Turing Test</li><li>Bayesian Analysis</li><li>Causal Diagrams<ol><li>Paths in Path Diagrams<ol><li>Chain junction</li><li>Fork Junction</li><li>Collider Junction</li></ol></li><li>Lessons from Path Diagrams</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>References</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>This book shows that data is stupid. Data can record events but cannot answer why any of the events are the way they are.</p>
<p>Causal inference posits the brain as the most advanced tool for understanding cause and effect.</p>
<p>Forcing an occurrence means to submit it to one influence to trigger the desired event</p>
<p><strong>Counterfactual:</strong> When scientific inquiry involves retrospective reflection. &quot;Why?&quot; is a counterfactual question.</p>
<p>Probabilities encode our beliefs about a static world. Causality explains probabilities in a changing world.</p>
<h3 id="benefits_of_causal_analysis">Benefits of Causal Analysis</h3>
<p>Create a smoother human-machine interface.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: I wonder if that is what attracted me to the idea of Causal Inference - that it enables better human-machine interfaces. Like human-machine interaction as a discipline; I wonder if they have much in this area. Perhaps reach out to Valentine Wilson about the question?</em></p>
<h3 id="critiques_of_statistics">Critiques of Statistics</h3>
<p>Galton separated causation from statistics in 1889 causing the two separate fields to fully manifest.</p>
<p>&quot;Granger causality&quot; and &quot;vector autocorrelation&quot; exists to accommodate for causal explanations. Associated Thoughts: Judea&#39;s critique on probability-based causality</p>
<h3 id="causal_calculus">Causal Calculus</h3>
<p>Causal calculus uses two communications forms: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Causal Diagrams: communicates what is known.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic language: defines what is wanted to be known</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="inference_engine">Inference Engine</h3>
<p>The inference engine assumes perfect and unlimited data for the given figure:</p>
<p><img src="../assets/01082021030619-inference-engine.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Estimand:</strong> generalized mathematical formula to answer data questions. A statistical quantity estimated from data that can represent an answer to a query.</p>
<p>A given estimand is computed on the basis of the causal model alone, prior to an examination of the specifics of the data. This gives the inference engine better adaptibility.</p>
<p><strong>Binary Evaluation of Query:</strong> determines if a query can be answered under an existing causal model.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge:</strong> experience from the past such as prior observations and education.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> explicit statements from available Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Queries:</strong> the scientific questions to be answered.</p>
<p><strong>Testable Implications:</strong> observable patterns or dependencies resulting from the listening pattern of a causal model.</p>
<p><strong>Estimate:</strong> Estimate for the answer is determined alongside uncertainty metrics.The metrics reflect limited data, measurement errors, or missing data.</p>
<h3 id="ladder_of_causality">Ladder of Causality</h3>
<p>First rung: observation. This concerns recognition of patterns. This rung asks, &quot;What if I see ...?&quot;</p>
<p>The second rung: Doing. Altering an environment to achieve a certain goal. This rung poses the questions of &quot;What if we do...?&quot; or &quot;How?&quot;</p>
<h3 id="mini-turing_test">Mini-Turing Test</h3>
<p>Mini-Turing Test: Encode a simple story on a machine and see if it can answer causal questions a human can answer.</p>
<p>Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Limited only to causal reasoning and language.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The story can be encoded in the easiest way for the programmer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bayesian_analysis">Bayesian Analysis</h3>
<p>Simplified Bayesian analysis: prior belief &#43; new evidence &#61; revised belief.</p>
<p>Bayesian inference enables one to express personal experiences mathematically and combine it with data in a principled and transparent way.</p>
<h3 id="causal_diagrams">Causal Diagrams</h3>
<p>&quot;Causation&quot; via a causal diagram is straightforward. A variable X is a cause of Y if Y listens to X. Y&#39;s value is determined by what it hears.</p>
<h4 id="paths_in_path_diagrams">Paths in Path Diagrams</h4>
<h5 id="chain_junction">Chain junction</h5>
\[
A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C
\]
<p>B is the mediator which relays the effect of A to C. B filters information about A from C.</p>
<h5 id="fork_junction">Fork Junction</h5>
\[
A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C
\]
<p>B is a confounder of A and C. B makes A and C statistically correlated despite no direct link between them.</p>
<h5 id="collider_junction">Collider Junction</h5>
\[
A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C
\]
<p>Conditioning on B will make A and C dependent</p>

</li>
<li><p>Path analysis draws conclusions about individual causal relationships by examining the diagram as a whole.</p>

<h3 id="what_is_satisfaction">What is Satisfaction?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m thirty-four years old, I oughta be makin&#39; my future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s when I come running home.  And now, I get here, and I don&#39;t know what to do with myself.  &#91;After a pause&#93; I&#39;ve always made a point of not wasting my life, and everytime I come back here I know that all I&#39;ve done is to waste my life.&quot; </p>
<p><em>Biff talking to his mother about his life&#39;s relative miserable existence</em></p>
<p>His obsession for not wasting his life or waiting almost for his life to start is similar to my thoughts. Interesting. I think the big thing is here is the overinflated notion of being &quot;big&quot; or important.  As though that were the ultimate goal of any man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All I can do now is wait for the merchandise manager to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And suppose I get to be merchandise manager?  He&#39;s a good friend of mine, and he just built a terrific estate on Long Island.  And he lived there about two months and sold it, and now he&#39;s building another one.  He can&#39;t enjoy it once it&#39;s finished.  And I know that&#39;s just what I would do.  I don&#39;t know what the hell I&#39;m workin&#39; for.  Sometimes I sit in my apartment—all alone.  And I think of the rent I&#39;m paying.  And it&#39;s crazy.  But then, it&#39;s what I always wanted.  My own apartment, a car, and plenty of women.  And still, goddammit, I&#39;m lonely.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Happy talking to his brother, Biff, about his own struggle and situation in life</em></p>
<p>This carries on the theme of the dissatisfaction with the attainment of being &quot;big&quot;. Happy got everything he could want but is still unhappy – contrasting this with Biff is that Biff is unhappy even though he did not get what he wanted.  These are two examples of being dissatisfied in uniquely different ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linda: &quot;&#91;to Willy ...&#93; Why must everybody conquer the world?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a powerful insight into Linda&#39;s thinking.  To Linda, Willy already has the best things in the world. He just can&#39;t stop to realize it or rather, it is not enough for him to have a loving family. He needs to be big in the eyes of &quot;people&quot;.  This reminds me of my note on <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07132020022756-media-timothy.md">&quot;False Expertise&quot;</a> where there, the problem is that being exposed enough to material gives you prestige. In this case, Willy thinks being acknowledged by people as a nice guy is enough to ensure endless success.</p>
<h3 id="shattering_of_innocence">Shattering of Innocence</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy: &quot;Never mind&#33;  He&#39;s going to give you those points.  I&#39;ll see to it.&quot; Biff: &quot;He wouldn&#39;t listen to you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The crushing moment when Biff sees through his father and loses complete faith in him.</em></p>
<p>I find this moment in the story more tragic than Willy&#39;s eventual death. It is this moment which doomed Willy and his family for the rest of his life.  It&#39;s never explained why Willy had an affair but, perhaps, that is the point.  A person does not need a reason for slipping.  I find it interesting how Willy tries to keep up the front of being an exemplar amongst men. Though Biff later calls his father, &quot;a prince among men,&quot; I believe it was to keep up Willy&#39;s pretense. I wonder if Willy did confess this incident to his family, if things may have been different...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all the highways, and the trains, and the appointments, and the years, you end up worth more dead than alive.&quot;</p>
<p>The moment in which Willy realizes his life is not moving towards any grand destiny and decides fully upon suicide. It&#39;s an interesting insight about the idea of providing incentives.</p>
<h3 id="false_expectations">False Expectations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy: &quot;Without a penny to &#91;my brother&#39;s name&#93;, &#91;...&#93; it&#39;s not what you do&#91;.&#93;  It&#39;s who you know and the smile on your face&#33;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crux of Willy&#39;s mentality on how life &quot;should be&quot; and how he expects life to work. Ultimately, this is proven false when he fails to get a job after pulling his contacts. In reality, nearly the exact opposite of this maxim is the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charley: &quot;The only thing you got in this world is what you can sell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the funny thing is that you&#39;re a salesman, and you don&#39;t know that.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Willy&#39;s neighbor Charley admonishing him on his frustration with the world not working they way Willy expects it to.</em></p>
<p>Ultimately, this searing criticism of Willy shows to him that he doesn&#39;t have any skills to offer outside of his perfunctory service as a salesman. He is a mediocre man who never tried to adapt and move with the times. And Willy refuses to believe that life passed him by in that way.</p>

<h3 id="psalm_5_scripture">Psalm 5 Scripture</h3>
<pre><code class="language-julia">Listen to my words, Lord, 
consider my lament. 
Hear my cry for help,
my King and my God,
for to you I pray.In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice;
in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.&#91;...&#93;But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
    let them ever sing for joy.
Spread your protection over them,
    that those who love your name may rejoice in you.Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous;
you surround them with your favor as with a shield.                                        - Psalms 5:1-3, 11-12</code></pre>
<h3 id="exegesis">Exegesis</h3>
<p>One of the key things to note about this passage is when the Psalmist chooses to lay his requests before God – the morning. If you wake up and the very first thing you do is cry and lament before God, then this illustrates a point of extreme stress. The object of stress in this Psalm is enough to haunt the writer&#39;s every waking moment. It causes enough concern for the Psalmist to wait on God to answer the writer.</p>
<p>Yet, what may or may not be implied from this is that the Psalmist still chooses rest and/or sleep. In verses 11 - 12, the Psalmist knows that God protects and blesses those who love Him and he chooses to have faith and trust in that knowledge to rest and rejoice. </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Takeaways from the book How to Take Smart Notes</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##bibliography #knowledge #notetaking #zettelkasten #mentalmodels #writing #blog #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>S. Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Quotes from the Book:</li></ol></li><li>References</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>This was overall a book on knowledge management – in particular, how to take, digest, and use the notes we make while reading material, listening to lectures, or absorb knowledge in general. Sonke Ahrens, the author of the book, also gave a rather in-depth overview of the Zettelkasten method created by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. I found the book useful in giving legitimately very good advice on note-taking, great anecdotes to illustrate his point, and also assistance on using the Zettelkasten method. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Ahrens made an interesting point saying that if you are approaching writing where you start with just a blank page, you are missing the point. When you approach a blank page, it <em>ought</em> not feel blank but rather the place to put your notes and ideas together that you have been collecting about a particular topic. Ahrens believes that fundamental teachings about how to write long-form papers are wrong in that they do not start with the most crucial aspect of the writing process – free form thought. And free form thought, when investigating a topic, is best captured using a global sort of note taking method like the Zettelkasten.</p>
<h3 id="quotes_from_the_book">Quotes from the Book:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-julia">&quot;Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note&quot; &#91;pg 8&#93;&quot;We only write if it helps us with our own thinking.&quot; &#91;pg 101&#93;</code></pre>
<p>These two quotes get at the idea that when we write and create notes, we are not only creating notes but also playing with ideas and digesting them into our minds.</p>
