<p>Social cohesion is the connectedness and solidarity in populations. This includes the absence of social conflict and presence of social bonds.27 A measure used to quantify social cohesion is trust. <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08192022115354-health-terrorism-factors">Social Determinants of Health, Violent Radicalization, and Terrorism: A Public Health Perspective</a></p>
<p>Social capital are the features of social structures that are resources for community members to create action.27 Social capital acts as a safety net for individuals to protect against losses like physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction.31<a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08192022115354-health-terrorism-factors">Social Determinants of Health, Violent Radicalization, and Terrorism: A Public Health Perspective</a> &#40;See <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08282022135955-social-capital">Features of Social Capital</a> for further insight on what social capital is and its importance&#41;</p>

<p>I personally only found this paper mildly interesting. In my research in terrorism, I was not as interested in this sort of research literature as it was too granular for what I was investigating – which was a broad level of investigation as an initial pass.</p>
<p>Their biggest takeaway from their study was that they found contrary to mainstream literature now, there is a socioeconomic impact to account for when researching terrorism. This especially extends the poor socioeconomic conditions individuals find themselves in such as insufficient welfare policies, economic discrimination, and low levels of economic openness. &#40;e.g., Burgoon, 2006; Blomberg and Hess, 2008; Krieger and Meierrieks, 2010; Caruso and Schneider, 2011&#41; Additionally, to fight terrorism, they surmised that improving socioeconomic conditions could in fact counter terrorist growth. </p>

<p>This paper was probably the best paper I have read on the subject of terrorism research and how it intersects with public health and the social determinants of health. It provided a comprehensive background on what terrorism and radicalism are as well as some very useful public health terminology introducing the concept of social cohesion and social capital. Furthermore, it got at the concept of how examining terrorism and gang violence from a public health perspective is very understudied and underutilized when exploring this space.</p>
<h3 id="public_health_approach_to_terrorism">Public Health Approach to Terrorism</h3>
<p>2.6&#37; of terrorism deaths happen in the West. 72&#37; belong to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Syria</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pakistan</p>
</li>
<li><p>Iraq</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nigeria</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afghanistan - Institute for Economics and Peace. Global Terrorism Index. New York, NY. 2015.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorism associated with negative mental health outcomes in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>depression</p>
</li>
<li><p>anxiety</p>
</li>
<li><p>posttraumatic stress disorder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amongst others - Rousseau C, Jamil U, Bhui K, et al. Consequences of 9/11 and the war on terror on children’s and young adult’s mental health: a systematic review of the past 10 years. Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2015;20:173–193.</p>
<h3 id="shortcomings_of_addressing_terrorism_from_a_public_health_perspective">Shortcomings of Addressing Terrorism from a Public Health Perspective</h3>
<p>Historically public health has focused on: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preparedness strategies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Containment of terrorist fallout</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What has been missing in this space is examining:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social determinants of terrorism</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determinants for violent radicalization</p>
</li>
<li><p>Risk factors for terrorism</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="factors_leading_to_extremism">Factors Leading to Extremism</h3>
<p>A case study from the United Kingdom shows that violent radicalization is an outcome of a complex interaction among social, political, cultural, historical, and interpersonal factors.7 </p>
<p>Discrimination can be thought of as a &quot;comorbidity&quot; of social isolation and exclusionary behavior. One form of systematic discrimination is immigration policy as it directly contributes to social segregation.9 Feelings of marginalization have been shown to lead to decreased self-worth and, in turn, increase radicalization.57 Those discriminated against could then fall easily to extremist influence and ideology as a result of weakening social cohesion.52</p>
<h3 id="studying_gang_violence_as_a_proxy_for_terrorist_groups">Studying Gang Violence as a Proxy for Terrorist Groups</h3>
<p>A proxy to study terrorism is to study gang violence</p>
<p>At the individual level, gangs and terrorist organizations appeal to individuals who are psychologically deviant, have limited access to socioeconomic opportunities, or are marginalized members of society.39–44 In fact, terrorist groups attract a range of unstable individuals.45</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This seems to contradict the paper <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08232022220130-people-become-terrorists">Why Do People Become Terrorists</a> as it notes that instead, it was observed how many of these people who are not fully psychologically deviant but rather of clear mind. Furthermore, in my attempt to reconcile such different observations, I would posit that rather, both explanations and comments are valid but that &quot;unstable individuals&quot; seem to conflate a kind of negative aspect to a person whereas the linked paper avoids the notion of unstable persons and instead explains how most of these people are of clear opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goals generally exclusive to gangs:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Symbolic ends</p>
</li>
<li><p>Looser structure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Less temporary collaborations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shorter memberships</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gang occupies physical space.46</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference between gangs and terrorist groups is that gangs are often not politically motivated.47 </p>
<h3 id="positive_approaches_to_mitigate_radicalization">Positive Approaches to Mitigate Radicalization</h3>
<p>Dutch police actively sought to integrate individuals from Syria by connecting them with a psychiatrist or mentor. Then, they provided assistance to find housing or means to return to school. To round out this reintegration process, they went even further to provide &quot;whatever they needed to fully integrate back into society.&quot;67 </p>
<p>This approach, believes that to fight terrorism through policing and/or &quot;profiling&quot; will create real or perceived discrimination, humiliation, and/or marginalization. Other papers have shown <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08232022220130-people-become-terrorists">this to be an accurate assessment</a>.</p>
<p>&lt;&#33;–TODO: Add citations to note–&gt;</p>
<h3 id="problems_with_whiteness_and_terrorism_classifications">Problems with Whiteness and Terrorism Classifications</h3>
<p>Muslim Americans who come from the Middle East are often classified as &quot;White&quot; by categories set forth by the Office of Management and Budget. However, this is in complete opposition to the fact that a large proportion of Muslim Americans do not identify as &quot;White&quot;. 15 An implicit assumption and implicit problem is that people labeled &quot;White&quot; are assumed to be &quot;racially neutral.&quot;15 </p>

<p>Poverty of material conditions alone does not explain a biological explanation for causes of impaired lifespans.</p>
<p>It is historically noted that there is a general shortage of randomized control trials to determine the utility of interventions in all areas of public health. DIscussion about the lack of controlled trials in public health pertaining to the social determinants area and the field of public health in general.</p>
<p>James Lind is rightly acknowledged as an exceptional public health figure because as early as the 18th century he conducted controlled investigations to show citrus fruit cured scurvy. By contrast, John Snow’s determination in the 19th century that ingestion of contaminated water led to cholera, relied on careful observation and the exercise of reasoned judgement rather than his uncontrolled experiment of removing the handle of the Broad Street pump.</p>
<p>When approaching the area of social determinants, risk factors were first separated from behaviours and biological markers.</p>
<p>Causes of the causes can be thought of as the underlying issues that give rise or is directly related to a given issue. </p>
<p>Second method of approach by Marmot to examine the social determinants of health. To give an example: &quot;It is not an accident that people consume diets high in saturated fat and salt. It represents the nature of the food supply, culture, affordability, and availability, among other influences.&quot;</p>
<p>The psychosocial understanding of the social determinants of health emphasizes experiential personal accounts. Negative accounts which induce acute and chronic stress affect human biology. This ultimately leads to impairment of physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The social gradient of health goes from the high echelons of society to those living in dire conditions. Each step down this hierarchy also lowers standards of health.</p>
<h3 id="the_fallacy_of_diseases_of_the_rich_and_poor">The Fallacy of Diseases of the Rich and Poor</h3>
<p>There existed the notion that there were diseases of the rich and of the poor. Mortality rate reflected this belief. However, this was false.</p>
<p>The impoverished are not the only ones to anguish. An example being that despite civil servants being economically well-off, it was found there was an inverse relationship between employment grade and risk for causes of death.</p>
<p>Stress does not only affect senior managers or others in positions of great public responsibility. High effort linked to high reward is generally health promoting. &#91;1&#93; Poor health is seen where there is limited, real or perceived, control over a situation with a small chance of reward where the situation is psychologically demanding during an extended period of time. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that infectionand immunity may also be important in two poorly recognized ways </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A contributory cause of diseases not previously considered to be due to infection</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chronic stress may alter susceptibility to infection and its severity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the_fight_or_flight_response_and_its_role_in_disease">The Fight Or Flight Response and Its Role in Disease</h3>
<p>The fight or flight response is brief and rather unusual for animals. The response can be vital for an animal&#39;s survival. For humans, emergencies are comparatively rare. However, for people, regular psychological demands and challenges may activate the fight or flight response too often. </p>
<p>Fight-or-flight adapts well to acute stress but may not to chronic stress in today’s urban environment. &#91;4&#93;</p>
<p>Prolonged elevated cortisol amounts can manifest paranoia or depression.</p>
<h4 id="sympatho-adrenal_pathway">Sympatho-Adrenal Pathway</h4>
<p><img src="07132020192025-heart-adrenaline.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Heart rate is directly impacted by sympathetic nerve impulses. It is indirectly affected by circulating adrenaline level.</p>
<p>Increased &quot;stickiness&quot; in platelets occurs due to increases in adrenaline in the blood. Blood tends to become more concentrated and viscous at the same time. Stress-related hormones can increase the output of fibrinogen from the liver. This may add to formation of arterial plaques and increased risks of heart disease and stroke &#91;5&#93;, &#91;6&#93;</p>
<p>The sympatho-adrenal pathway activates, prepares for, or maintains physical exertion. It causes psychological arousal and energy mobilization. It inhibits functions irrelevant to immediatesurvival. Degree of activation depends on stressorand its duration. Thesympatho-adrenal pathway can be switched off rapidly.</p>
<p>The first pathway is the sympatho-adrenal pathway and activates quickly. It consists of the sympathetic branch of the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12302020174059-autonomic-nervous-system">autonomic nervous system</a>. The pathway produces two hormones:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Noradrenaline at nerve endings</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adrenaline directly into the bloodstream by the medulla &#40;or middle part&#41; of the adrenal glands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This produces the sensation of our stomach tightening when being exposed to sudden shock.</p>
<h4 id="hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal_hpa_axis">Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; Axis</h4>
<p><img src="07132020192442-hpa-axis.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure from Chapter 2 of &#91;7&#93;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; Axis operates over minutes and hours. Its key components are the three corresponding hormone secreting glands. The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; axis is the slower, seconday response to stress. It results in cortisol release into the bloodstream from adrenal glands. The dotted lines show feedback controls which regulate release of cortisol and other corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex.</p>
<h4 id="effects">Effects</h4>
<p>Circulating adrenaline and sympathetic nerve activity generated during the Fight or Flight response:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Accelerate heart rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase metabolic rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase blood pressure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase sensory vigilance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase sweat secretion</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate pupils</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate airways</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate blood vessels in skeletal muscles</p>
</li>
<li><p>Constrict blood vessels in skin and gut</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inhibit salivation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Glucocorticoid hormones, like cortisol, have metabolic and psychological effects. These hormones are vital to upkeep and regulation of resting and stress-related metabolic functions. </p>
<p>In emergency situations, glucocorticoid hormones are antagonistic to the insulin hormone, resulting in the mobilization of energy reserves via elevation of blood glucose and fatty acid release from fat tissues. This is very desirable in emergencies. </p>
<p>However, in non-emergencies, unneeded energy that can be released tends to increase output into the blood of cholesterol-carrying particles from the liver.</p>
<h4 id="overall_response_to_stress">Overall Response to Stress</h4>
<p><img src="07132020191448-stress-baselines.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Shown are idealized representations of neuroendocrine and metabolic activity in the presence of stress. &#40; a &#41; depicts rapid baseline recovery as responsive and flexible &#40; b &#41; illustrates a slow recovery but an eventual delayed return to baseline &#40; c &#41; shows a weak reaction with an elevated baseline alongside a small response.</p>
<p>If a stress response is activated too regularly, feedback controls within the neuroendocrine system could reset one&#39;s baseline to a new elevated and potentially health-damaging level driven by environmental factors &#91;8&#93;, &#91;9&#93;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>How the brain, HPA axis, and immunesystem communicate with one another. The brain perceives cognitive stimuli. This perception can influence immune function via neuropeptides, the ANS, and the HPA axis. The immune system responds to non-cognitive stimuli. Examples of non-cognitive stimuli are infection and tumour growth. Cytokines and peptidehormones are secreted which affect the brain and neuroendocrine system. <em>RQ: ASD dysregulation of cytokines are directly impacted by the interference COVID19 thus further complicating response in the HPA axis.</em></p>
<h4 id="social_effects_on_well-being">Social Effects on Well-Being</h4>
<p><img src="07132020184157-well-being-impacts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Further, the balance of influences on health depends on geographical location and historical circumstances of the population in question.</p>
<p>This generalized diagram includes circumstances beyond individual control as well as personal situations. From the top left to the bottom right, there is a clear chain of influence between social structure and well-being.</p>
<p>Given the correct information, a similar pictogram could be made for each category of disease.</p>
<p>Current thoughts about everything which can impact overall well-being.</p>
<p>The social and cultural environment and organization of work are current factors in consideration in public policy. Psychological and biological factors are latent causes of disease. These tend to be the main focus of medical attention. In reality, these factors are intermediates on the pathway from social position to an individual&#39;s state of health. &#91;10&#93;</p>
<p>Social structure affects an individual via three primary influences:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Material circumstances are related to health directly through one&#39;s social and work environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Material circumstances then impacts psychological factors and health-related behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Early life experiences, cultural, and genetic factors also exert influences on health.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One example is a study of children at orphanages:</p>
<p>Under the same food conditions, children in the ‘Bienenhaus&#39; orphanage under the control of a stern Fraülein Schwarz, gained less weight and grew slowly. This opposite to children under the care of the affectionate Fraülein Grün at the ‘Vogelnest&#39; orphanage.  Schwarz replaced Grün during the study at ‘Vogelnest&#39; and growth rates were subsequently reversed. This controlled cross-over study provides evidence that adverse psychosocial circumstances in childhood can influence growth. &#91;11&#93;</p>
