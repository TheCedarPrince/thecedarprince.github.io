<p>H. A. Simon, &quot;How Big Is a Chunk? By combining data from several experiments, a basic human memory unit can be identified and measured.,&quot; Science, vol. 183, no. 4124, pp. 482–488, 1974.</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>In reading a piece by Michael Nielsen on using spaced repetition to process mathematics &#91;1&#93;, he referenced a concept called &quot;chunking&quot;. I hadn&#39;t encountered this notion in education research before and thought it sounded interesting.  So, thus reading the paper.</p>
<h3 id="what_are_chunks">What Are Chunks?</h3>
<p>Loosely based on &#91;2&#93;, chunks are constructs which organize and group together units of information input into memory. These inputs can be of any form and the basic units could be things like phonemes in words, moves in chess, etc. that can then be recalled at once &#40;a Bible verse, a Sicilian Defense, etc.&#41;. The material stored in a chunk is independent of how many chunks can be generated.</p>
<h3 id="benefits_of_chunk_generation">Benefits of Chunk Generation</h3>
<p>The memory span seems to be constrained by a fixed number of chunks &#40;although this number varies wildly in the paper&#41;.  However, we can increase the information stored in memory by increasing the number of units belonging to each chunk. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>As regaled by Simon, an example of chunking in action is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried to recall after one reading the following list of words: Lincoln, milky, criminal, differential, address, way, lawyer, calculus, Gettysburg. I had no success whatsoever. I should not have expected success, for the list exceeded my span of six or seven words. Then I rearranged the list a bit, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg Address</p>
</li>
<li><p>Milky Way</p>
</li>
<li><p>Criminal Lawyer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Differential Calculus</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I had no difficulty at all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The variance between chunks and memory can be attributed to larger chunk sizes based on one&#39;s expertise with a material. &#91;4&#93;</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I read this paper to find out more about the social vulnerability index and how it can be used in the state of Georgia. It wasn&#39;t particularly insightful although the discussion about calculating SVI for GA and its definition about social vulnerability was helpful.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>Social vulnerability is defined as the extent to which a community contains social characteristics that may affect the community&#39;s overall resilience &#40;18&#41;. It is affected by 	- Situational factors: Employment, Education, Income, Housing Type &#40;19, 20&#41; 	- Intrinsic factors: Age, Race, and Ethnicity &#40;19, 21&#41;</p>

<p>I never knew the term for this but historically, where African Americans were heavily enslaved is called the &quot;Black Belt&quot;. The authors found that high SVI and heat-related deaths were often found in these historical communities &#91;32&#93;.</p>

<h3 id="reading_movation">Reading Movation</h3>
<p>I wanted to read this paper to get more a sense for vulnerable populations. Although I was less interested in the specific applications to rural communities, I found the discussion around rural vulnerabilities very interesting as well as clarification around definitions.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_vulnerability">What Is Vulnerability?</h3>
<p>Vulnerable populations are those subgroups that are at risk for experiencing elevated healthcare disparities. &#40;De Chesnay &amp; Anderson, 2016; Shi &amp; Stevens, 2010&#41;.</p>
<p>A potential model to assess vulnerability is that proposed by &#40;Grabovschi et al., 2013&#41; where it can be visaulized as a right triangle with the horizontal axis representing healthcare accessibility and quality; vertical axis represents healthcare needs; hypotenuse is the level of vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="barriers_often_encountered_in_rural_healthcare_settings">Barriers Often Encountered in Rural Healthcare Settings</h3>
<p>Health disparities continue to be a severe problem across US populations. &#40;Crosby, Wendel, Vanderpool, &amp; Casey, 2012; Penman-Aguilar et al., 2016&#41; Trends in inequalities emerge for patients seeking healthcare across multiple factors such as race, socioeconomic status, and provider accessibility.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rural dwellers tend to lack insurance compared to urban settings &#40;Barker, Londeree, McBride, Kemper, &amp; Mueller, 2013; Soni, Hendryx, &amp; Simon, 2017&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many rural dwellers travel more than 30 minutes for healthcare - it is especially exacerbated where public transportation is lacking and severe poverty exists &#40;Warren &amp; Smalley, 2014, p. xiii&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities_most_often_studied_in_rural_health_literature">Vulnerabilities Most Often Studied in Rural Health Literature</h3>
<p>46 articles were studied for this systematic review. Population sizes ranged from 10 to 30,874 people. For quantitative studies, populations ranged from 28 to 30,874 participants.</p>

<h3 id="recommendations_for_future_research">Recommendations for Future Research</h3>
<p>Only one article calculated a power analysis &#40;Komro et al., 2015&#41;.</p>
<p>Power analysis are used in quantitative research to limit error between hypothesis and findings.</p>
<p>There was observed an overrelianceon descriptive correlational designs that impeded adequate theory testing. Studies should incorporate theories and theoretical applications relevant to rural populations.</p>

<p>I personally only found this paper mildly interesting. In my research in terrorism, I was not as interested in this sort of research literature as it was too granular for what I was investigating – which was a broad level of investigation as an initial pass.</p>
<p>Their biggest takeaway from their study was that they found contrary to mainstream literature now, there is a socioeconomic impact to account for when researching terrorism. This especially extends the poor socioeconomic conditions individuals find themselves in such as insufficient welfare policies, economic discrimination, and low levels of economic openness. &#40;e.g., Burgoon, 2006; Blomberg and Hess, 2008; Krieger and Meierrieks, 2010; Caruso and Schneider, 2011&#41; Additionally, to fight terrorism, they surmised that improving socioeconomic conditions could in fact counter terrorist growth. </p>

<p>This paper was probably the best paper I have read on the subject of terrorism research and how it intersects with public health and the social determinants of health. It provided a comprehensive background on what terrorism and radicalism are as well as some very useful public health terminology introducing the concept of social cohesion and social capital. Furthermore, it got at the concept of how examining terrorism and gang violence from a public health perspective is very understudied and underutilized when exploring this space.</p>
<h3 id="public_health_approach_to_terrorism">Public Health Approach to Terrorism</h3>
<p>2.6&#37; of terrorism deaths happen in the West. 72&#37; belong to:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Afghanistan - Institute for Economics and Peace. Global Terrorism Index. New York, NY. 2015.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorism associated with negative mental health outcomes in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>depression</p>
</li>
<li><p>anxiety</p>
</li>
<li><p>posttraumatic stress disorder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amongst others - Rousseau C, Jamil U, Bhui K, et al. Consequences of 9/11 and the war on terror on children’s and young adult’s mental health: a systematic review of the past 10 years. Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2015;20:173–193.</p>
<h3 id="shortcomings_of_addressing_terrorism_from_a_public_health_perspective">Shortcomings of Addressing Terrorism from a Public Health Perspective</h3>
<p>Historically public health has focused on: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preparedness strategies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Containment of terrorist fallout</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What has been missing in this space is examining:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social determinants of terrorism</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determinants for violent radicalization</p>
</li>
<li><p>Risk factors for terrorism</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="factors_leading_to_extremism">Factors Leading to Extremism</h3>
<p>A case study from the United Kingdom shows that violent radicalization is an outcome of a complex interaction among social, political, cultural, historical, and interpersonal factors.7 </p>
<p>Discrimination can be thought of as a &quot;comorbidity&quot; of social isolation and exclusionary behavior. One form of systematic discrimination is immigration policy as it directly contributes to social segregation.9 Feelings of marginalization have been shown to lead to decreased self-worth and, in turn, increase radicalization.57 Those discriminated against could then fall easily to extremist influence and ideology as a result of weakening social cohesion.52</p>
<h3 id="studying_gang_violence_as_a_proxy_for_terrorist_groups">Studying Gang Violence as a Proxy for Terrorist Groups</h3>
<p>A proxy to study terrorism is to study gang violence</p>
<p>At the individual level, gangs and terrorist organizations appeal to individuals who are psychologically deviant, have limited access to socioeconomic opportunities, or are marginalized members of society.39–44 In fact, terrorist groups attract a range of unstable individuals.45</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This seems to contradict the paper <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08232022220130-people-become-terrorists.md">Why Do People Become Terrorists</a> as it notes that instead, it was observed how many of these people who are not fully psychologically deviant but rather of clear mind. Furthermore, in my attempt to reconcile such different observations, I would posit that rather, both explanations and comments are valid but that &quot;unstable individuals&quot; seem to conflate a kind of negative aspect to a person whereas the linked paper avoids the notion of unstable persons and instead explains how most of these people are of clear opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goals generally exclusive to gangs:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Symbolic ends</p>
</li>
<li><p>Looser structure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Less temporary collaborations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shorter memberships</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gang occupies physical space.46</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference between gangs and terrorist groups is that gangs are often not politically motivated.47 </p>
<h3 id="positive_approaches_to_mitigate_radicalization">Positive Approaches to Mitigate Radicalization</h3>
<p>Dutch police actively sought to integrate individuals from Syria by connecting them with a psychiatrist or mentor. Then, they provided assistance to find housing or means to return to school. To round out this reintegration process, they went even further to provide &quot;whatever they needed to fully integrate back into society.&quot;67 </p>
<p>This approach, believes that to fight terrorism through policing and/or &quot;profiling&quot; will create real or perceived discrimination, humiliation, and/or marginalization. Other papers have shown <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08232022220130-people-become-terrorists.md">this to be an accurate assessment</a>.</p>
<p>&lt;&#33;–TODO: Add citations to note–&gt;</p>
<h3 id="problems_with_whiteness_and_terrorism_classifications">Problems with Whiteness and Terrorism Classifications</h3>
<p>Muslim Americans who come from the Middle East are often classified as &quot;White&quot; by categories set forth by the Office of Management and Budget. However, this is in complete opposition to the fact that a large proportion of Muslim Americans do not identify as &quot;White&quot;. 15 An implicit assumption and implicit problem is that people labeled &quot;White&quot; are assumed to be &quot;racially neutral.&quot;15 </p>

<p>T. Y. Sun, S. Bhave, J. Altosaar, and N. Elhadad, “Assessing Phenotype Definitions for Algorithmic Fairness,” arXiv:2203.05174 &#91;cs, q-bio&#93;, Mar. 2022, Accessed: Apr. 29, 2022. &#91;Online&#93;. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05174</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I wanted to read this article as it was highly recommended to me by my friend, Jaan Altosaar, one of the coauthors of this piece. I was very interested in the methods they used and the approach they took to address fairness in phenotypes as although I had heard about discrepancies in phenotypes, this was a bit of a watershed paper to read in my mind exposing how phenotyping can be so skewed. Really fantastic paper and will be returning to it.</p>
<h3 id="purpose_of_paper">Purpose of Paper</h3>
<p>Biases introduced at phenotype level can risk exacerbating existing health disparities by influencing clinical guidelines and public policy is what this paper argues</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Phenotyping:</strong> Identifying a set of patients with a particular disease</p>
<p><strong>Phenotype Definitions:</strong> the process of sorting patients based on a disease they have into cohorts. This phenotyping to create definitions is done to learn more about a specific condition such as: 	- Epidemiological queries &#40;e.g., quantifying incidence of disease overtime&#41; &#40;Dubberke et al., 2012&#41; 	- Estimating and predicting risk &#40;Kaelber et al., 2012&#41;  	- Comparing effectiveness &#40;Suchard et al., 2019&#41;</p>
<p>The basis of demographic parity is the federal fourfths rule, which states that a selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than fourfths of the rate of the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact</p>
<h3 id="types_of_biases_found_in_phenotyping">Types of Biases Found in Phenotyping</h3>
<p><strong>Diagnosis Bias:</strong> a bias that prevents or causes delays to a disease diagnosis for a population due to differences in how that disease may present for that particular population. Example: 	- Heart attack literature finds that men complain of chest pain more frequently 	- Woman are likely to complain of other forms of pain. 	- Phenotype definition for heart attack with chest pain as the core symptom may not capture women &#40;Coventry et al., 2011&#41;.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment bias:</strong> a bias that prevents or causes delays to a treatment for population groups. Example: 	- VA black patients less likely to receive cardio-protective drugs than white patients &#40;Mehta et al., 2010 </p>
<p><strong>Access to Care Bias:</strong> biases that are systemic issues preventing patients from accessing healthcare options. Example: 	- Phenotype definition that requires a diagnosis to occur in outpatient settings could underrepresent patients.</p>
<h3 id="common_fairness_metrics">Common Fairness Metrics</h3>
<p><strong>Demographic Parity:</strong> difference in proportion for each protected class that receives the positive and negative outcome. Also referred to as &quot;independence&quot; or &quot;statistical parity&quot;.</p>
\[
P_0(\hat{Y}=\hat{y})=P_1(\hat{Y}=\hat{y}) \forall \hat{y} \in\{0,1\}
\]
<p><strong>Equality of Opportunity:</strong> when true positive rates of a model are equal across demographics</p>
\[
P_0(\hat{Y}=1 \mid Y=1)=P_1(\hat{Y}=1 \mid Y=1)
\]
<p><strong>Predictive Rate Parity:</strong> when probability of true labels given the predicted label is the same across classes</p>
\[
P_0(Y=1 \mid \hat{Y}=1)=P_1(Y=1 \mid \hat{Y}=1)
\]
<p>and </p>
\[
P_0(Y=0 \mid \hat{Y}=0)=P_1(Y=0 \mid \hat{Y}=0)
\]

<p>An overview of how telehealth interventions could and should be deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>S. Chang et al., &quot;Mobility network models of COVID-19 explain inequities and inform reopening,&quot; Nature, vol. 589, no. 7840, pp. 82–87, Jan. 2021, doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2923-3.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Points of Interest</li><li>Counterfactual Mobility Network</li><li>Limitations</li><li>Conclusions</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>Iterative proportional fitting &#91;1&#93; was used to make POI –&gt; <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/01202021043013-census-groups.md">CBG</a> networks from SafeGraph data. SafeGraph mobility data was validated against Google mobility data.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: What is iterative proportional fitting?</em></p>
<p>Model fits observed daily case counts from 8 March to 9 May 2020</p>
<h3 id="points_of_interest">Points of Interest</h3>
<p>POI hourly infection rate determined via:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Area</p>
</li>
<li><p>Median visit duration</p>
</li>
<li><p>Time-varying density of infectious individuals</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Three free time-invariant parameters that scale:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>POI transmission rates</p>
</li>
<li><p>CBG transmission rates</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initial amount of exposed individuals</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Points of interest for this paper are such as: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Restaurants</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grocery stores</p>
</li>
<li><p>Religious establishments</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Certain categories of POIs contributed far more to infections like restaurants and hotels The model predicted time-dependent variation - likely due to policy change.</p>
<p>Model can identify at-risk populations and determined that disadvantaged racial socioeconomic groups face higher rates of infection.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: This conclusion seems very obvious – of course people are going to have to move and keep doing things.</em></p>
<h3 id="counterfactual_mobility_network">Counterfactual Mobility Network</h3>
<p>Counterfactual mobility network creation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Scaling magnitude of mobility reduction down</p>
</li>
<li><p>Positioning the model at different times</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apply model to counterfactual networks to simulate infection trajectories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: What is a counterfactual network? I wonder in what sense they are using the word &quot;counterfactual&quot;?</em></p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>Limitations of dataset:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some populations missing</p>
</li>
<li><p>All POIs not ID&#39;d</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does not break up CBGs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The model is sparse.  It does not include all real-world disease transmission variables.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>COVID-19 superspreader events &#91;2&#93;–&#91;5&#93; motivate risk modeling. Infection rates among different people groups &#91;6&#93;–&#91;12&#93; require modeling effects of the virus on disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The observed disparity was driven by a few POIs. Majority of infections from small fraction of superspreader POIs.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably because they cannot work from home as easily.&quot; &#91;10&#93;</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: It almost feels insulting that after this entire analysis, there is only one footnote on the topic of what people actually experience. On the flip side, I can empathize where a research group could lack time and/or means to contextualize results. Either way, it feels ripe to build on top of this work/paper to better examine the actual effects of policy adjustments and life changes.</em></p>
<p>CBGs with fewer white residents had higher predicted infection risks.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: Seems somewhat odd? This is interesting to me in how they keep bringing up race or economic status as a variable, but never fully commit to an investigation. Feels really weird to talk about issues without actually addressing them.</em></p>
<p>Mobility data showed average grocery store visits from lower-income CBGs had 59&#37; more hourly visitors per square foot. Median metro area data showed they stayed 17&#37; longer.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<h4 id="review_process">Review Process</h4>
<p>First stage, a white European male&#39;s reflection on academic research in DRC and setting up Marakuja Kive Research group.  Second stage, two Congolese researchers and Marakuja Kive Research founders review ideas in initial draft.</p>
<p>Retreating to safety founded on racial inequality creates a resource for researchers to access - consciously or not. This is often hard to identify due to delicacy of research endeavors. In Africa, is race colonial legacy or a resource for projects actively relied on, or both?</p>
<h4 id="research_projects_are_a_lucrative_business">Research Projects Are a Lucrative Business</h4>
<p>International research projects are beginning to much more resemble supply chains &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Increased demands for data in research enabled businesses based on multi-actor business models and knowledge value chains to exist &#91;2&#93; Quantitative research is closer to the big data sector. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Three main groups of people enable the collection of data. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Western, generally white researchers control project resources; namely funding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Non-Western associates: their work is usually hidden from outputs &#91;4&#93;, &#91;5&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Subjects who are generally from lower socio-economic positioning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: Point 1 reminds me of the Communist Manifesto by Marx on those that control the means of production.</em></p>
<p>Data derives its value from its rawness at extraction and via processing.  International academic pipeline construction is analogous to generic resource mining: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>African data is collected</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exported</p>
</li>
<li><p>Processed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Converted to high value goods &#40;papers, reports, etc.&#41;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This mirrors very closely how international academic endeavors can look like a supply chain.</p>
<h4 id="accidental_whiteness">Accidental Whiteness</h4>
<p>White academics incidentally separate to give themselves a sense of racial inapplicability &#91;6&#93;, &#91;7&#93;</p>

<h3 id="the_failure_of_the_publication_machine">The Failure of the Publication Machine</h3>
<p>Publication has been extended beyond usefulness of the record. Current methods for finding relevant information is impractical.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: Very convicting retrospection on how we handle copious amounts of information. A record which contains too little information is not informative and one that contains too much is overwhelming.</em></p>
<p>Those who try to stay current with research may have difficulty to recall last month&#39;s material studied.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: This is so convicting&#33; Even though it is a nearly 80 year old paper, the problems that he discusses are still in existence&#33;  The problem of having too many papers and the inability to extract the truly worthwhile pieces of information are still present.</em></p>
<h3 id="the_idea_of_automated_knowledge_systems">The idea of Automated Knowledge Systems</h3>
<p>When one associates information along logical processes, creativity is limited to data selection to match a process. After this initial surge of creativity, the work is fit for automation</p>
<h3 id="regarding_thought">Regarding Thought</h3>
<p>There exist no substitute for nuanced thinking. Imagination and repetitious thinking are diverse. Repetitive thought is much easier automated.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: I like this notion of repetitive thought. As much as there are repetitive thought, there are repetitive actions accordingly.</em></p>

<p>This book shows that data is stupid. Data can record events but cannot answer why any of the events are the way they are.</p>
<p>Causal inference posits the brain as the most advanced tool for understanding cause and effect.</p>
<p>Forcing an occurrence means to submit it to one influence to trigger the desired event</p>
<p><strong>Counterfactual:</strong> When scientific inquiry involves retrospective reflection. &quot;Why?&quot; is a counterfactual question.</p>
<p>Probabilities encode our beliefs about a static world. Causality explains probabilities in a changing world.</p>
<h3 id="benefits_of_causal_analysis">Benefits of Causal Analysis</h3>
<p>Create a smoother human-machine interface.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: I wonder if that is what attracted me to the idea of Causal Inference - that it enables better human-machine interfaces. Like human-machine interaction as a discipline; I wonder if they have much in this area. Perhaps reach out to Valentine Wilson about the question?</em></p>
<h3 id="critiques_of_statistics">Critiques of Statistics</h3>
<p>Galton separated causation from statistics in 1889 causing the two separate fields to fully manifest.</p>

<p><strong>Estimand:</strong> generalized mathematical formula to answer data questions. A statistical quantity estimated from data that can represent an answer to a query.</p>
<p>A given estimand is computed on the basis of the causal model alone, prior to an examination of the specifics of the data. This gives the inference engine better adaptibility.</p>
<p><strong>Binary Evaluation of Query:</strong> determines if a query can be answered under an existing causal model.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge:</strong> experience from the past such as prior observations and education.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> explicit statements from available Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Queries:</strong> the scientific questions to be answered.</p>
<p><strong>Testable Implications:</strong> observable patterns or dependencies resulting from the listening pattern of a causal model.</p>
<p><strong>Estimate:</strong> Estimate for the answer is determined alongside uncertainty metrics.The metrics reflect limited data, measurement errors, or missing data.</p>
<h3 id="ladder_of_causality">Ladder of Causality</h3>
<p>First rung: observation. This concerns recognition of patterns. This rung asks, &quot;What if I see ...?&quot;</p>
<p>The second rung: Doing. Altering an environment to achieve a certain goal. This rung poses the questions of &quot;What if we do...?&quot; or &quot;How?&quot;</p>
<h3 id="mini-turing_test">Mini-Turing Test</h3>
<p>Mini-Turing Test: Encode a simple story on a machine and see if it can answer causal questions a human can answer.</p>
<p>Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Limited only to causal reasoning and language.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The story can be encoded in the easiest way for the programmer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bayesian_analysis">Bayesian Analysis</h3>
<p>Simplified Bayesian analysis: prior belief &#43; new evidence &#61; revised belief.</p>
<p>Bayesian inference enables one to express personal experiences mathematically and combine it with data in a principled and transparent way.</p>
<h3 id="causal_diagrams">Causal Diagrams</h3>
<p>&quot;Causation&quot; via a causal diagram is straightforward. A variable X is a cause of Y if Y listens to X. Y&#39;s value is determined by what it hears.</p>

<h3 id="methods_and_materials">Methods and Materials</h3>
<p>Changes in population movement based on stay-at-home orders between March 1–May 31, 2020 given by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories were examined.</p>
<h4 id="classifying_stay-at-home_orders">Classifying Stay-at-Home Orders</h4>
<p>Coding of orders was based solely on the legal language in each state or territorial order. Stay-at-home orders were assigned a mutually exclusive category based on this language:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All required &#40;language examples: persons &quot;shall,&quot; &quot;must,&quot; or &quot;are directed to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Applied to persons in specific jurisdictions&#39; locations &#40;language examples: persons &quot;shall,&quot; &quot;must,&quot; or &quot;are directed to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Required for individuals &gt; 65 years or with underlying conditions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mandatory for individuals &gt; 65 years or with underlying conditions in specific jurisdictions&#39; locations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not required but advised to stay home &#40;language examples: persons &quot;should,&quot; &quot;are encouraged to,&quot; or &quot;are urged to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jurisdictions that did not issue an order were coded as having no state- or territory-issued order</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="determining_time_windows">Determining Time Windows</h4>
<p>Given a state &quot;s&quot; that issues a stay-at-home order at date &quot;t&quot;, pre- and post-order windows for each county, &quot;c&quot;, in a state can be defined. c&#39;s preorder window contains movement values, m, during the time period before, t. The postorder window contains m values during the time period after t. Each county&#39;s preorder window serves as a county- and COVID-specific baseline. Small time values observed during these periods reflect county-specific invariants and impacts of the pandemic on behavior in the absence of state- or territory-issued community mitigation policies. ***QUESTION:** What is a sufficiently small value of n-days &#40;or time period before and after t&#41;?* ***QUESTION:** What is a county-specific invariant?*</p>
<p>Order index date types:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each jurisdiction&#39;s counties</p>
</li>
<li><p>Waning or end of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each jurisdiction&#39;s counties</p>
</li>
<li><p>Date of the first state stay-at-home order</p>
</li>
<li><p>Date of the first termination of a state stay-at-home order</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="analyzing_for_changes_in_population_movement_patterns">Analyzing for Changes in Population Movement Patterns</h4>
<p>Counties were broken into rural-urban categories to ensure groupings of counties with similar population sizes. Box plots were constructed for each category to examine the distribution of county mean percentages of devices at home during the pre- and postorder periods associated with each index date. Movement values following a normal distribution was not assumed for all counties and periods.  A clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test was then performed, with counties as clusters, on the constituent counties&#39; median pre- and post-order values associated with each index date. A lower-tailed test was used for dates regarding the start of regional mandates. An upper-tailed test was used for dates recording the end of regional mandates. Strata-level statistical significance was assessed at the 99&#37; confidence level &#40;alpha &#61; 0.01&#41;. <em>Dataset used: <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/documentation/">The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s Rural-Urban Continuum Codes</a> are used to stratify counties in this analysis</em> <strong>QUESTION:</strong> What is a &quot;clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test&quot;?_</p>
<p>Population movement was inferred via the percentage of individual devices reported each day that were home for each county. A 7-day rolling average was used to smooth each county&#39;s pre- and postorder time series values ***QUESTION:** I wonder how good a metric this observation serves as a proxy of measuring population movement?*</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<h4 id="general_insights">General Insights</h4>
<p>Regions which issued stay-at-home mandates saw general declines in population movement. At the same time as the first state relaxed their mandate, regions that had not relaxed their mandates saw increased population movement. Stay-at-home orders can reduce activities associated with community spread of COVID-19. This includes population movement and external person-to-person contact.</p>
<h4 id="limitations_of_this_analysis">Limitations of this analysis</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Device coverage correlates with US pop density.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, certain regions or groups might be inequitably represented. ***QUESTION:** How does relative device coverage largely correlate with US pop density?*</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>People may have multiple mobile devices and might take any number of them when they leave home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test is used with counties as clusters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is because a county&#39;s median pre- and postorder values are paired comparisons. Possible spatial dependence between counties wasn&#39;t addressed.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>The report does not account for nationwide protests affects on mobility patterns.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The only relationship analyzed was between stay-at-home orders and population movement.</p>
</li>

<p>This study provides a template for understanding large economic shocks as they happen to counter the problem of data availability during major economic shocks. The start of the pandemic saw an unprecedented decline in economic activity in the US. The largest single month decline in US unemployment was 14 percent in April 2020.</p>
<p>The federal government&#39;s response totalled to nearly three trillion dollars spent to counter pandemic effects. Their response comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Economic Impact Payments &#40;tax rebates&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Small business loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Massive increase in unemployment insurance as part of the CARES Act</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methods_of_research">Methods of Research</h3>
<p>Basic Monthly Current Population Survey &#40;Monthly CPS&#41;, was used due to its quick release to understand the impact of macroeconomic conditions and government policies on US families&#39; incomes.</p>
<p>Family income from respondents in their first or fifth month in the survey were observed for a monthly sample ranging from 8,999 households and 20,822 individuals in February 2020 to 6,149 households and 14,383 individuals in April 2020.  Monthly CPS data from IPUMS-CPS &#91;1&#93; Generally, 90&#37; of earnings are reported in CPS, as opposed to ~60&#37; of unemployment insurance. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="key_conclusions">Key Conclusions</h3>
<p>Without US government intervention, poverty would have risen by 2.7 percentage points between January and June.</p>
<p>The COVID Impact survey &#91;3&#93; finds an increase in food insecurity when compared to a different earlier survey while the Census Bureau&#39;s Household Pulse survey &#91;4&#93; finds high rates of inability to pay rent.  These sources suggest increased hardship after the pandemic. The increase in deprivation is not due to the overall income loss, but rather due to other disruptions of the pandemic, including possibly the unevenness of the income flows.</p>
<p>Disruptions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Closures of schools</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stores</p>
</li>
<li><p>Churches and other facilities</p>
</li>
<li><p>The uncertainty about future income streams</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concerns about the health of family and friends</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other disruptions</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not believe the author is very familiar with the notion of mutltimodal analysis or standard data fusion methodologies. This was such a strange article that was more excitement and jubilation over the phenomenon of the possibility of computable phenotypes that I think the author was distracted from the message they were trying to convey. Though, they did talk about some applications regarding lung injury and sepsis, there was nothing really to suggest novelty in their assessment.</p>
<p>I reviewed this author&#39;s work and it appears the author has no formal training in informatics or analytics. So, I do not fault them for this article - however, to me, it read like something out of MIT Technology Review or a Science &amp; Technology Magazine. Not a professional scientific publication.</p>

<p>E. A. Allen, E. B. Erhardt, and V. D. Calhoun, &quot;Data Visualization in the Neurosciences: Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality,&quot; Neuron, vol. 74, no. 4, pp. 603–608, May 2012, doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.05.001.</p>

<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Methods</li><li>Purpose</li><li>Ways to Reduce Complexity</li><li>Common Perceptions of Neuroscience Visualizations<ol><li>Bar Plots</li></ol></li><li>Key Takeaways</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>1,451 figures were examined from 288 neuroscience papers in 2010.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>They investigated current practices in data visualization in the realm of neuroscience and offered potential improvements to better reveal data than hide it.</p>
<p>Using work by Howard Wainer, Allen and co developed questions that were used to determine the effectiveness of particular visualizations.  These were the questions they came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Quantity of interest labeled?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scale of the dependent variable indicated?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Measure of uncertainty displayed &#40;as needed&#41;?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is the type of uncertainty &#40;e.g., standard error bars or confidence intervals&#41; defined in the figure or accompanying legend?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Interesting how they based it off of Wainer.  That paper on depicting error may be worth a read.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ways_to_reduce_complexity">Ways to Reduce Complexity</h3>
<p>Efficient method introduced to analyze rapidly changing functional patterns is by transforming fMRI <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12282020020156-brain-biomarkers.md">BOLD</a> data to point processes. &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93; Achieved by selecting peaks of the BOLD signal in each <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11302020054820-voxel.md">voxel</a>. This reduction of data by &gt; 95&#37;, has been found very similar to inferences of functional connectivity from full signal analysis. &#91;3&#93;, &#91;4&#93;</p>
<p><em>QUESTION: What is a point process? Why is BOLD important?</em></p>
<h3 id="common_perceptions_of_neuroscience_visualizations">Common Perceptions of Neuroscience Visualizations</h3>
<p>Researchers may choose values for great visual appeal and easier interpretation. However, it reduces the analysis to a binary representation that suffers from the limitations of all-or-none hypothesis testing. &#91;5&#93;</p>
<p>Aesthetically pleasing brain image results are viewed more persuasive and credible than identical information presented in less appealing formats. &#91;6&#93;, &#91;7&#93;</p>
<p>Effective data visualization communicates that the data displayed does contain some uncertainty and that it quantifies that uncertainty as it pertains to conclusions one would make off the visualization. &#91;8&#93; - <em>Thoughts by Howard Wainer</em></p>
<h4 id="bar_plots">Bar Plots</h4>
<p>The usage of Bar Plots in neuroscience can certainly be beneficial but are not without their drawbacks:</p>
<p><strong>Pros of bar plots</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Easy to generate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Straightforward to comprehend</p>
</li>
<li><p>Efficiently contrast a large number of conditions in a small space.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Great for binary data samples that reflect successes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons of bar plots</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Commonly used in scenarios where distance from zero is not meaningful</p>
</li>
<li><p>Doesn&#39;t show distributional information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key_takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>To better improve understanding of figures, integrating descriptions into the figure itself can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discourages misinterpretation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lead to quicker understanding of figure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional annotation should not detract from figure</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependent variables are more difficult to label when they represent abstract parameter estimates rather than directly measured quantities. Uncertainty is more challenging to render when data sets require error surfaces rather than error bars.  Displays should become increasingly informative regarding complex data in illustrating relationships that would not be well defined in tables or values alone.</p>

<p><em>QUESTION: One thing that I realize and think a lot about from this paper is the question of: how easy is it to represent this sort of additional information that tells more the story of the neuroscientific data? Obviously, the authors have expertise with making their own tools.  But what about for those who do not have them?</em></p>

<h3 id="what_is_satisfaction">What is Satisfaction?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m thirty-four years old, I oughta be makin&#39; my future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s when I come running home.  And now, I get here, and I don&#39;t know what to do with myself.  &#91;After a pause&#93; I&#39;ve always made a point of not wasting my life, and everytime I come back here I know that all I&#39;ve done is to waste my life.&quot; </p>
<p><em>Biff talking to his mother about his life&#39;s relative miserable existence</em></p>
<p>His obsession for not wasting his life or waiting almost for his life to start is similar to my thoughts. Interesting. I think the big thing is here is the overinflated notion of being &quot;big&quot; or important.  As though that were the ultimate goal of any man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All I can do now is wait for the merchandise manager to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And suppose I get to be merchandise manager?  He&#39;s a good friend of mine, and he just built a terrific estate on Long Island.  And he lived there about two months and sold it, and now he&#39;s building another one.  He can&#39;t enjoy it once it&#39;s finished.  And I know that&#39;s just what I would do.  I don&#39;t know what the hell I&#39;m workin&#39; for.  Sometimes I sit in my apartment—all alone.  And I think of the rent I&#39;m paying.  And it&#39;s crazy.  But then, it&#39;s what I always wanted.  My own apartment, a car, and plenty of women.  And still, goddammit, I&#39;m lonely.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Happy talking to his brother, Biff, about his own struggle and situation in life</em></p>
<p>This carries on the theme of the dissatisfaction with the attainment of being &quot;big&quot;. Happy got everything he could want but is still unhappy – contrasting this with Biff is that Biff is unhappy even though he did not get what he wanted.  These are two examples of being dissatisfied in uniquely different ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linda: &quot;&#91;to Willy ...&#93; Why must everybody conquer the world?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a powerful insight into Linda&#39;s thinking.  To Linda, Willy already has the best things in the world. He just can&#39;t stop to realize it or rather, it is not enough for him to have a loving family. He needs to be big in the eyes of &quot;people&quot;.  This reminds me of my note on <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07132020022756-media-timothy.md">&quot;False Expertise&quot;</a> where there, the problem is that being exposed enough to material gives you prestige. In this case, Willy thinks being acknowledged by people as a nice guy is enough to ensure endless success.</p>
<h3 id="shattering_of_innocence">Shattering of Innocence</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy: &quot;Never mind&#33;  He&#39;s going to give you those points.  I&#39;ll see to it.&quot; Biff: &quot;He wouldn&#39;t listen to you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The crushing moment when Biff sees through his father and loses complete faith in him.</em></p>
<p>I find this moment in the story more tragic than Willy&#39;s eventual death. It is this moment which doomed Willy and his family for the rest of his life.  It&#39;s never explained why Willy had an affair but, perhaps, that is the point.  A person does not need a reason for slipping.  I find it interesting how Willy tries to keep up the front of being an exemplar amongst men. Though Biff later calls his father, &quot;a prince among men,&quot; I believe it was to keep up Willy&#39;s pretense. I wonder if Willy did confess this incident to his family, if things may have been different...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all the highways, and the trains, and the appointments, and the years, you end up worth more dead than alive.&quot;</p>
<p>The moment in which Willy realizes his life is not moving towards any grand destiny and decides fully upon suicide. It&#39;s an interesting insight about the idea of providing incentives.</p>
<h3 id="false_expectations">False Expectations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy: &quot;Without a penny to &#91;my brother&#39;s name&#93;, &#91;...&#93; it&#39;s not what you do&#91;.&#93;  It&#39;s who you know and the smile on your face&#33;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crux of Willy&#39;s mentality on how life &quot;should be&quot; and how he expects life to work. Ultimately, this is proven false when he fails to get a job after pulling his contacts. In reality, nearly the exact opposite of this maxim is the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charley: &quot;The only thing you got in this world is what you can sell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the funny thing is that you&#39;re a salesman, and you don&#39;t know that.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Willy&#39;s neighbor Charley admonishing him on his frustration with the world not working they way Willy expects it to.</em></p>
<p>Ultimately, this searing criticism of Willy shows to him that he doesn&#39;t have any skills to offer outside of his perfunctory service as a salesman. He is a mediocre man who never tried to adapt and move with the times. And Willy refuses to believe that life passed him by in that way.</p>

<p>The central hypotheses of this paper are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>IDD persons have higher prevalence of conditions associated with higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outcomes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Case-fatality rate would be higher for COVID19 individuals with IDD than without IDD.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="data_methods">Data Methods</h3>
<p>COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a COVID-19 diagnosis code or a positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test result since January 20, 2020. Patients were categorized as those with and without diagnosed developmental disability, including intellectual disability &#40;F70-79&#41;, cerebral palsy &#40;G80&#41;, Down syndrome &#40;Q90&#41;, and other developmental disabilities &#40;F80-89, Q91-99&#41;.</p>
<p>Documentation was provided for comorbidities related to risk for severe outcomes with COVID-19 up to the date of the first COVID-19 documentation. Trends in number of cases, number of deaths, and case-fatality rates were compared between COVID19 patients with IDD and without IDD. Age distributions for number of cases and number of deaths were computed for both patient groups. Deaths occurring within 30 days of the date of first COVID-19 documentation in the EMR were identified and used to calculate case-fatality rates and 95&#37; confidence intervals. Age groups were selected based upon the knowledge that COVID-19 rates are substantially lower among children, &#91;1&#93; and that a disproportionately lower percent of adults with IDD live into older age. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>We excluded patients with diagnosis codes of other specified viral infection &#40;ICD-9 code: 097.89&#41; or suspected exposure to other biologic agents &#40;ICD-10 code: Z03.818&#41; during the same timeframe</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> COVID-19 case rates, case fatality, and mortality rates will be elevated for IDD persons abiding in residential group homes.</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>They assume the majority of cases reported in this study are likely for symptomatic individuals.</p>
<p>Residential group home data are from New York Disability Advocates. Homes typically have 7 residents, but range from between 4 and 14 residents. All residents are age 18 and over. NYDA data includes: number of residents, COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, and COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p>Residential group homes are required to complete a COVID-19 screen and temperature check at least once per day in homes that have not had a prior confirmed case. For a prior confirmed case, screening and checks once per shift. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>IDD individuals experience health disparities and high prevalence of comorbidities. &#91;2&#93; Many of which areassociated with more severe COVID19 outcomes. &#91;3&#93;, &#91;4&#93; There is a paucity of IDD health research. &#91;5&#93;, &#91;6&#93; Furthermore, the CDC only issued COVID-19 guidance relevant to this population in late May. <em>RQ: That&#39;s absurd how long it took the CDC to issue guidelines about this population. I wonder if WHO has issued any guidelines related to individuals with IDD?</em></p>
<p>There may be increased risk from COVID-19 for individuals living in congregate care settings due to difficulty in maintaining physical distancing. &#91;7&#93;–&#91;9&#93; It is estimated that 13&#37; of IDD adults reside in congregate care settings, &#91;10&#93; with shared use of essential living spaces, closeproximity to others, high levels of personal care assistancefrom staff, and multiple shift staffing patterns. &#91;11&#93;  <em>RQ: It seems like the authors are insinuating that individauls with IDD are at increased risk for COVID19 due to group care facilities.  Not so much biologic dysfunction. However, I think they say later there is biologic concern.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The journal medical hypothesis lacks a standard peer review process, but is often utilized to posit ideas quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Purpose of paper:</strong> consolidate data to support the hypothesis of ASD being a risk for COVID19 like other risks.</p>
<p>Involves several modifications at the genetic and at the immune level &#40;e.g. increases of inflammatorycytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels&#41;. &#91;1&#93; Some are conditions considered risk-factor of symptomatic COVID-19 and its mortality.</p>
<h3 id="cytokine_observations_in_asd_and_covid19">Cytokine Observations in ASD and COVID19</h3>
<p>Initially there is an endogenous immune response in the presence of COVID19. The response is linked to the destruction level of the virus, the patient’s innateresponse, and it determines its inflammation status and symptomatology. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Secretory increases of ACE-2 was correlated with COVID-19 patients &#91;3&#93;. There seem to exist an ACE-2 superexpression leading to a pro-inflammatory state, related to cardiac and pulmonary damage &#91;3&#93; ACE-2 is a regulator in angiotensin-2transformation into angiotensin-&#40;1-7&#41; metabolite. It has inflammatory effects producing vasodilatation, anti-proliferation and apoptosis. This is common to CVD conditions &#91;4&#93;.</p>
<p>Coronavirus also has the characteristic of being neuroinvasive. &#91;5&#93; This characteristic shows via:- Febrile seizures - Encephalitis - Convulsions - Change in mental status Some neurological symptomsfound in COVID-19 patients are non-specific, such as headache, dizziness and confusion. Neurological symptoms were directly related to patients. &#91;6&#93; Thereby, we can hypothesize that its physiopathology might have a strict relation with the nervous system.</p>

<p>Based on the results, taking rest is best for maintaining vigilance. A different perspective can proffer an explanation for this: </p>
<p>Differing tasks which interrupt one during a vigilance task may both utilize distinctly unique resources and require different amounts of resources. The tasks may have elicited different levels of cognitive load.</p>
<p>There exist on-going debate about the origins of vigilance decrement &#91;1&#93;. The best known is based on resource theory. However critics think it is a circular mode of reasoning &#91;2&#93;.</p>
<p>Current findings suggest that vigilance decrement comes from repeated use of executive resources. There may be domain specific interference when the primary task and activities during a break make use of the same resources.</p>
<p>The findings by Ariga do not support the idea that vigilance decrement is due to task under-load. &#91;3&#93; Knowing why resting can assist with refocusing is difficult. Perhaps, rest allowed participants to engage in day dreaming which eliminated task monotony. </p>

<p>P. Feyerabend, <em>Against method</em>, 3rd ed. London ; New York: Verso, 1993.</p>

<h3 id="general_themes">General Themes</h3>
<p>The goal of Against Method is to show that all methodologies have limits.</p>
<p>&quot;Passion&quot;, in Kierkegaard&#39;s sense, should encourage playful exploration of ideas. This passion results in behavior that facilitates circumstances and ideas which can produce a logical framework regarding an idea. &#91;1&#93;  Feyerabend contends that people rely on too narrow and fixed frameworks to understand the world. Only one principle that guides learning under any circumstance of human development is the principle &quot;anything goes.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_His central thesis somewhat reminds me of the teaching about everything being permissible but not everything being beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder how the two can be related fully._</p>
<p>Knowledge according to Feyerabend is not a harmonious convergence towards an ideal. Rather, it is an ocean of alternatives that forces ideas into succinct articulation. Each idea competitively contributes to the development of consciousness. This makes a lot of sense. Rather than ideas being fixed in the mind, they are ever open to change and influence. Unanimity of opinion works for tyranny contends Feyerabend. Variety however is needed for objective knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy Principle:</strong> facts exist and are independent of whether one considers alternatives to the theory to be tested.</p>
<p><strong>Theoretical numerical disagreement:</strong> A theory determines a predicted value. What is obtained in reality differs from the prediction.</p>
<h3 id="limits_of_current_education">Limits of Current Education</h3>
<p>Scientific education has the aim of making concepts more accessible at the cost of strict and unchangeable rules.  An essential part of training inhibits intuitions that might lead to a blurring of boundaries. It does this by simplifying its participants in the following manner:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A domain of research is defined.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The domain is separated from the rest of history.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>This domain is then given a &#39;logic&#39; of its own.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Training in such &#39;logic&#39; then conditions the domain&#39;s disciples.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It makes their actions more uniform and it freezes large parts of the historical process as well.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Stable &#39;facts&#39;  independent of opinion, belief, and cultural background arise and persevere despite the vicissitudes of</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>history.</p>
<p>Makes me think of Godel&#39;s principle that there is a limit to what can be proved within a given domain given the tools of that domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relevant Quote:  &quot;A person&#39;s religion, for example, or his metaphysics, or his sense of humour must not have the slightest connection with his scientific activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His imagination is restrained, and even his language ceases to be his own.&quot;</p>
<p>The <strong>consistency condition</strong> of modern academia demands new hypotheses to agree with accepted theories. It preserves the older theory but not the better theory. Theories should only be changed when a theory disagrees with facts. Discussion of incompatible facts will lead to progress. Discussion of incompatible hypotheses will not.</p>

<p>The false idea that repetition improves memory traces back to the mid-1960&#39;s. Psychologist Endel Tulving, from the University of Toronto, tested people on their ability to remember lists of common English nouns.</p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>Feedback has been extensively studied. &#91;1&#93; It can lead to the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strengthen effects of testing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be of greater benefit if it&#39;s slightly delayed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enhance positive and reduces the negative effects of multiple choice testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Frequent immediate feedback can be detrimental to long-term learning for motor skills at it provides a crutch during practice that isn&#39;t present during the test. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="effects_of_quizzing">Effects of Quizzing</h3>
<p>Quizzing produced a significant improvement relative to no quizzing or directed review of target concepts on unit exams and on cumulative semester and end-of-year exams. A well-placed review quiz produced benefits on the exams that were as robust as several repeated quizzes in some cases.</p>
<p>This phenomenon was first researched at Columbia Middle School. &#91;3&#93;, &#91;4&#93; They reported well-controlled experiments on the benefits of quizzing for middle school students&#39; performances on classroom exams in social studies and science.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics_of_learning">Characteristics of Learning</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Learning needs memory</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning is a lifelong endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning is an acquired skill; often counterintuitive.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a roadmap for the skill you want to learn. Determine how best to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimize your situation to make learning and concentrating, easy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at.</p>

<li><p>Know why and what you forget. Begin to remember information for long-term benefit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Build a thorough understanding of concepts via experimenting or playing with new ideas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="make_a_roadmap_for_a_learning_project">Make a Roadmap for a Learning Project</h3>
<p>You should invest ~10 percent of your expected learning time into research prior to starting a project.</p>
<h4 id="what_is_the_project_and_what_does_it_entail">What Is the Project and What Does It Entail?</h4>
<p>When asking the question of &quot;What&quot; regarding a learning project, break the knowledge of a subject into &quot;Concepts,&quot; &quot;Facts,&quot; and &quot;Procedures.&quot; This enables the understanding of concepts to be understood in flexible ways. Thankfully, when breaking done this information, facts generally only need to be memorized but a deep understanding may not be not required. In the same vein, procedures are actions that need to be performed and do not involve much conscious thinking.</p>
<h4 id="how_do_we_approach_the_project">How Do We Approach The Project?</h4>
<p>Employing the <strong>Emphasize/Exclude Method</strong> is to find areas of study that align with identified goals. Part of this method is to omit or delay from your curriculum material which do not align with your goals. Familiarize yourself with what is common for <strong>benchmarking</strong>, or the ways people learn a skill or subject, regarding your project.</p>
<p><strong>Directness:</strong> learning being directly related to the way you want to use the information.</p>

<p>Poverty of material conditions alone does not explain a biological explanation for causes of impaired lifespans.</p>
<p>It is historically noted that there is a general shortage of randomized control trials to determine the utility of interventions in all areas of public health. DIscussion about the lack of controlled trials in public health pertaining to the social determinants area and the field of public health in general.</p>
<p>James Lind is rightly acknowledged as an exceptional public health figure because as early as the 18th century he conducted controlled investigations to show citrus fruit cured scurvy. By contrast, John Snow’s determination in the 19th century that ingestion of contaminated water led to cholera, relied on careful observation and the exercise of reasoned judgement rather than his uncontrolled experiment of removing the handle of the Broad Street pump.</p>
<p>When approaching the area of social determinants, risk factors were first separated from behaviours and biological markers.</p>
<p>Causes of the causes can be thought of as the underlying issues that give rise or is directly related to a given issue. </p>
<p>Second method of approach by Marmot to examine the social determinants of health. To give an example: &quot;It is not an accident that people consume diets high in saturated fat and salt. It represents the nature of the food supply, culture, affordability, and availability, among other influences.&quot;</p>
<p>The psychosocial understanding of the social determinants of health emphasizes experiential personal accounts. Negative accounts which induce acute and chronic stress affect human biology. This ultimately leads to impairment of physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The social gradient of health goes from the high echelons of society to those living in dire conditions. Each step down this hierarchy also lowers standards of health.</p>
<h3 id="the_fallacy_of_diseases_of_the_rich_and_poor">The Fallacy of Diseases of the Rich and Poor</h3>
<p>There existed the notion that there were diseases of the rich and of the poor. Mortality rate reflected this belief. However, this was false.</p>
<p>The impoverished are not the only ones to anguish. An example being that despite civil servants being economically well-off, it was found there was an inverse relationship between employment grade and risk for causes of death.</p>
<p>Stress does not only affect senior managers or others in positions of great public responsibility. High effort linked to high reward is generally health promoting. &#91;1&#93; Poor health is seen where there is limited, real or perceived, control over a situation with a small chance of reward where the situation is psychologically demanding during an extended period of time. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that infectionand immunity may also be important in two poorly recognized ways </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A contributory cause of diseases not previously considered to be due to infection</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chronic stress may alter susceptibility to infection and its severity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the_fight_or_flight_response_and_its_role_in_disease">The Fight Or Flight Response and Its Role in Disease</h3>
<p>The fight or flight response is brief and rather unusual for animals. The response can be vital for an animal&#39;s survival. For humans, emergencies are comparatively rare. However, for people, regular psychological demands and challenges may activate the fight or flight response too often. </p>
<p>Fight-or-flight adapts well to acute stress but may not to chronic stress in today’s urban environment. &#91;4&#93;</p>
<p>Prolonged elevated cortisol amounts can manifest paranoia or depression.</p>
<h4 id="sympatho-adrenal_pathway">Sympatho-Adrenal Pathway</h4>
<p><img src="07132020192025-heart-adrenaline.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Heart rate is directly impacted by sympathetic nerve impulses. It is indirectly affected by circulating adrenaline level.</p>
<p>Increased &quot;stickiness&quot; in platelets occurs due to increases in adrenaline in the blood. Blood tends to become more concentrated and viscous at the same time. Stress-related hormones can increase the output of fibrinogen from the liver. This may add to formation of arterial plaques and increased risks of heart disease and stroke &#91;5&#93;, &#91;6&#93;</p>
<p>The sympatho-adrenal pathway activates, prepares for, or maintains physical exertion. It causes psychological arousal and energy mobilization. It inhibits functions irrelevant to immediatesurvival. Degree of activation depends on stressorand its duration. Thesympatho-adrenal pathway can be switched off rapidly.</p>
<p>The first pathway is the sympatho-adrenal pathway and activates quickly. It consists of the sympathetic branch of the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12302020174059-autonomic-nervous-system.md">autonomic nervous system</a>. The pathway produces two hormones:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Noradrenaline at nerve endings</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adrenaline directly into the bloodstream by the medulla &#40;or middle part&#41; of the adrenal glands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This produces the sensation of our stomach tightening when being exposed to sudden shock.</p>
<h4 id="hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal_hpa_axis">Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; Axis</h4>
<p><img src="07132020192442-hpa-axis.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure from Chapter 2 of &#91;7&#93;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; Axis operates over minutes and hours. Its key components are the three corresponding hormone secreting glands. The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; axis is the slower, seconday response to stress. It results in cortisol release into the bloodstream from adrenal glands. The dotted lines show feedback controls which regulate release of cortisol and other corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex.</p>
<h4 id="effects">Effects</h4>
<p>Circulating adrenaline and sympathetic nerve activity generated during the Fight or Flight response:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Accelerate heart rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase metabolic rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase blood pressure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase sensory vigilance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase sweat secretion</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate pupils</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate airways</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate blood vessels in skeletal muscles</p>
</li>
<li><p>Constrict blood vessels in skin and gut</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inhibit salivation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Glucocorticoid hormones, like cortisol, have metabolic and psychological effects. These hormones are vital to upkeep and regulation of resting and stress-related metabolic functions. </p>
<p>In emergency situations, glucocorticoid hormones are antagonistic to the insulin hormone, resulting in the mobilization of energy reserves via elevation of blood glucose and fatty acid release from fat tissues. This is very desirable in emergencies. </p>
<p>However, in non-emergencies, unneeded energy that can be released tends to increase output into the blood of cholesterol-carrying particles from the liver.</p>
<h4 id="overall_response_to_stress">Overall Response to Stress</h4>
<p><img src="07132020191448-stress-baselines.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Shown are idealized representations of neuroendocrine and metabolic activity in the presence of stress. &#40; a &#41; depicts rapid baseline recovery as responsive and flexible &#40; b &#41; illustrates a slow recovery but an eventual delayed return to baseline &#40; c &#41; shows a weak reaction with an elevated baseline alongside a small response.</p>
<p>If a stress response is activated too regularly, feedback controls within the neuroendocrine system could reset one&#39;s baseline to a new elevated and potentially health-damaging level driven by environmental factors &#91;8&#93;, &#91;9&#93;</p>

<p>How the brain, HPA axis, and immunesystem communicate with one another. The brain perceives cognitive stimuli. This perception can influence immune function via neuropeptides, the ANS, and the HPA axis. The immune system responds to non-cognitive stimuli. Examples of non-cognitive stimuli are infection and tumour growth. Cytokines and peptidehormones are secreted which affect the brain and neuroendocrine system. <em>RQ: ASD dysregulation of cytokines are directly impacted by the interference COVID19 thus further complicating response in the HPA axis.</em></p>
<h4 id="social_effects_on_well-being">Social Effects on Well-Being</h4>
<p><img src="07132020184157-well-being-impacts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Further, the balance of influences on health depends on geographical location and historical circumstances of the population in question.</p>
<p>This generalized diagram includes circumstances beyond individual control as well as personal situations. From the top left to the bottom right, there is a clear chain of influence between social structure and well-being.</p>
<p>Given the correct information, a similar pictogram could be made for each category of disease.</p>
<p>Current thoughts about everything which can impact overall well-being.</p>
<p>The social and cultural environment and organization of work are current factors in consideration in public policy. Psychological and biological factors are latent causes of disease. These tend to be the main focus of medical attention. In reality, these factors are intermediates on the pathway from social position to an individual&#39;s state of health. &#91;10&#93;</p>
<p>Social structure affects an individual via three primary influences:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Material circumstances are related to health directly through one&#39;s social and work environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Material circumstances then impacts psychological factors and health-related behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Early life experiences, cultural, and genetic factors also exert influences on health.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One example is a study of children at orphanages:</p>
<p>Under the same food conditions, children in the ‘Bienenhaus&#39; orphanage under the control of a stern Fraülein Schwarz, gained less weight and grew slowly. This opposite to children under the care of the affectionate Fraülein Grün at the ‘Vogelnest&#39; orphanage.  Schwarz replaced Grün during the study at ‘Vogelnest&#39; and growth rates were subsequently reversed. This controlled cross-over study provides evidence that adverse psychosocial circumstances in childhood can influence growth. &#91;11&#93;</p>

<p>J. Pater and E. Mynatt, &quot;Defining Digital Self-Harm,&quot; in Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, Portland Oregon USA, Feb. 2017, pp. 1501–1513, doi: 10.1145/2998181.2998224.</p>

<p>This paper aims to define what digital self-harm is.</p>
<p>Digital self harm: online communication and activity that leads to, supports, or exacerbates non-suicidal yet intentional harm or impairment of an individual’s physical wellbeing.  It includes consuming and generating online content.  Digital self-harm occurs when a person’s behaviors are negatively influenced through his or her online activities in such a manner that these online activities lead to the infliction of non-suicidal direct or indirect physical harm to oneself. </p>
<p>Traditionally, eating disorder treatments generally include individual and family therapy or group therapy. Interpersonal and cultural forces that sustain self-harm activities are scrutinized.</p>
<p>As a field, CSCW and HCI health research appears to unconsciously emphasize the positive health benefits of technology &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93;.  This unaddressed bias can have great consequences on platform design and policy and must be scrutinized.</p>
<p>Digital self-harm is believed to be growing at a rate that will not stop without check. &#91;4&#93;</p>
<h3 id="examples_of_digital_self-harm">Examples of Digital Self-Harm</h3>
<p>Pro-anorexic digital self-harm example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT, GO ON A DIET FATTY.  ONE IS EITHER ANA/MIA OR NOT. IT IS A GIFT AND YOU CANNOT DECIDE TO HAVE AN EATING DISORDER. SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT, S-S-S-S-SORRY JUNIOR&#33;&#33; MOVE ON, TRY JENNY CRAIG</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two different ways the language around cutting is used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normalizing behavior: attempts in legitimizing activities to deal with mental health issues</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pathologizing behavior: focuses on a bodily disgust with the behavior being wrong morally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems_with_the_internet">Problems with the Internet</h3>
<p>The internet creates an environment for reinforced strengthening of behavioral issues within an affected individual through encouragement of destructive behaviors. This sort of cybernetic reinforcement mechanism could lead to the fast and serious manifestations of underlying disease symptoms.</p>
<p>ED websites may have contagion-like effects on individuals investigating eating disorders prior to exhibiting any commitment to a disorder. &#91;5&#93; Regarding adolescents, a concern is a healthy desire for weight-loss could lead to unintended exposure of ED content.</p>
<p><em>QUESTION: I wonder if there is a corollary definition about unintentional digital self-harm? People who are not necessarily interested in self-harm, but come into it anyways.</em></p>

<h3 id="issues_regarding_the_adoption_of_the_spacing_effect_into_classroom_settings">Issues regarding the adoption of the spacing effect into classroom settings.</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The spacing effect has not been studied in recent years</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect is still relatively new</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect does not have any thing to do with current issues educators face.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect has yet to be shown well in school activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are gaps in literature about the spacing effect</p>
</li>
<li><p>School-based studies do not show the spacing effect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect has not been well demonstrated in a classroom setting</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not enough is known about practical class implementation to warrant application of the spacing effect</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect is not well comprehended</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most concerning issues concerning usage of the spacing effect:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ahistorical character of research on the spacing effect</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some failures to obtain the effect with school-like activities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paucity of impressive classroom demonstrations of the phenomenon</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limited knowledge of classroom practice</p>
</li>
<li><p>Incomplete understanding of the psychological bases of the spacing effect</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Probably the most legitimate barrier to utilization of the spacing effect in educational settings is the scarcity of in class demonstrations of its usage.</strong></p>
<p>However, these four issues are not considered as such strong impediments to the implementation of the spacing effect in classroom settings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is not new and has been studied</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continues to receive recent documentation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can assist in addressing educational issues</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is demonstrated to lend itself well to school-like activities</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="miscellaneous_concepts">Miscellaneous Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Lag effects</strong> are believed to occur when performance on a memory task improves as the number of intervening items between successive presentations increases.</p>
<p><strong>Jost&#39;s Law:</strong> If two memories are equal in how well they were learned but at differing times, the older memory will gain more out of a review than the new one. &#91;1&#93;</p>

<p>84 students &#40;37 males, 47 female&#41; involved.</p>
<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Mindlessness theory:</strong> vigilance decrement is due to gross inattention or mindlessness. During monotonous vigilance tasks, supervisory attentional systems lose their effectiveness and observers perform the task in a thoughtless manner. Essentially, zoning during a task such as driving a regular path to work or making a bed. &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Vigilance tasks often show a negative sloping curve as a function of time. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Vigilance decrement does not concern depletion of attention resources. It is about a loss of control over our thoughts.</p>
<p>Heightened levels of vigilance can be maintained over prolonged periods of time with the use of infrequent, controlled breaks from a particular vigilance task. &#91;4&#93;</p>
<p>Ariga proposes that with respect to cognitive control, vigilance decrement may have difficulties due to goal habituation. Ariga argues thatgoals which draw on cognitive faculties should show effects similar to habituation.</p>
<p>Arriga argues that vigilance decrements ought be observed for any task that is performed continuously if goal habituation happens.  It should not depend necessarily on the extent to which the task can be routinized</p>
<p><strong>Task-Unrelated-Thoughts:</strong> when we subconsciously disengage from a task and start thinking about other related subjects</p>
<p>How Ariga believes vigilance decrement should be viewed. Cognitive control is also known as executive control. &#91;5&#93;, &#91;6&#93; Ariga&#39;s posits vigilance decrement is a failure of cognitive control. This is in contrast to the current thought that vigilance decrement is the inability to recover resources needed for retention as a function of time.</p>
<p>The defintion of habituation </p>
<p><strong>Habituation effect:</strong> the gradual diminishing of representation to sustained stimulation. Can occur even when being actively involved in tasks that require cognitive effort &#91;7&#93;, &#91;8&#93; and in tasks regarding meaning &#91;9&#93; This links back to how Ariga views vigilance decrement.</p>

<h3 id="study_set-up">Study Set-up</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Due to time constraints, 10 replications per time interval was used, instead of the 12 to 45 by Ebbinghaus. This means the variance in our data is larger than in Ebbinghaus&#39; especially at the longest time intervals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Were not able to experiment at fixed times during the day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our stimulus material conformed to the phonotactics of the Dutch language</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our subject was younger than H. Ebbinghaus</p>
</li>
<li><p>We do not know exactly when he learned and relearned the lists for the longer intervals. Makes it impossible to calculate the number of interfering lists between learning and relearning. nearly certain that our schedule differed from his</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A practice phase was used to prevent general learning effects due to growing experience with the task and materials.</p>
<p>The number of correct syllables at first reproduction of a row at relearning. Did not have to be the correct location where the word was learned.</p>
<p>The main value monitored was amount of repetitions required to correctly reproduce syllables in a row sequence.</p>
<p>Learning material consisted of 70 lists. Each list consisted of 104 nonsense syllables, which in turn consisted of 8 &#39;rows&#39; of 13 syllables.</p>
<p>Lists were printed on paper in black ink with font &quot;Calibri&quot; at size 11. There were eight rows per page. Each row was arranged into a column format for ease of study. Rows not being studied were covered by sheets of paper.</p>
<p>Syllables consisted of 3 or 4 lower-case letters. Its structure was a lower-case consonant-vowel-consonant.</p>
<p>Syllables with meanings in other languages spoken by the subject, such as English and German, were not excluded.</p>
<p>These are the key points that differentiate their study from Ebbinghaus&#39;s original study. Furthermore, listed is how the study was conducted. </p>
<h3 id="useful_concepts">Useful Concepts</h3>
<p>Savings is time minimized on an upcoming learning trial after having had prior exposure to that learning material. Hermann Ebbinghaus came up with this idea&#33; An example of this concept is: imagine one repeated a list 25 times to prefectly memorize the list. After a day of rest, instead of 25 repititions to relearn the list, one only needs 20. In this sense, a saving of 20&#37; took place.</p>
<p>Single-subject studies are normal in memory psychology. Especially common concerning autobiographical memory based on one&#39;s own memories &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93;. A benefit is that no intersubject variability exists. However, these studies need hundreds of trials to decrease variance based on confounding stimuli.</p>
<p>Ebbinghaus used nonsense syllables as material to learn for his experiments. He did this because he thought that legitimate material could be complicated by his pre-existing memories leading to a higher variance in his experimental data. &#91;4&#93;  Many scientists in experimental psychology now use this same approach.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that the first night&#39;s sleep post-learning has an important impact on memory that may continue to adapt several days after. A temporary increase in the forgetting curve where subjects score better than after learning in the days following sleep can be seen. However, it is not experienced if they skipped the night of sleep after learning &#91;5&#93;</p>
<p>How sleep can impact and benefit the learning of new material. The forgetting curve is not completely smooth and jumps at the 1 day retention interval. One possible explanation for this jump is based on the effects of sleep on memory. However, that explanation has not been proven for this study type.</p>
<p><strong>Implicit memory:</strong> where an individual may not be consciously aware they still possess traces of memory representations but one cannot actively recall or recognize these representations. These old traces do show savings when relearning that corresponding material. <em>RQ: This intuitively makes sense to me after much study and practice in languages and other domains. I wonder how long implicit memory lasts?</em></p>
<p><strong>Memory Chain Model:</strong> posits memory passes through several neural processes - &quot;stores&quot; - as it transitions from short-term to long-term memory. &#91;6&#93; It can be used to model the forgetting curve and &quot;savings&quot;. Store 1, the hippocampus, acts as a temporary storage which decreases exponentially in intensity. Store 2, the neocortex, is for long-term memory where it declines at a much slower rate. Store 1 gradually shifts its contents to Store 2. The decay rates in Store 1 and Store 2 are given by \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\), respectively. The initial strength of the memory traces in Store 1 are given by \(\mu_{1}\) and the rate of consolidating the contents of Store 1 to Store 2 is given by μ2. Lesioning Store 1, will produce a retrograde amnesia gradient that can be modeled by the Memory Chain Model simultaneously with the forgetting gradient of healthy controls. &#91;7&#93; The Memory Chain Model &#40;MCM&#41; equation for type of savings studied here is given by \(Q(t) = \mu_{1}e^{a_{1}t} + \frac{\mu_{1}\mu_{2}(e^{-a_{2}t} - e^{-a_{1}t})}{a_{1} -a_{2}}\)The MCM function has the same number of parameters but they are arranged differently. The proof that this equation is a mathematical formalization of the memory consolidation process can be found elsewhere. &#91;7&#93;</p>

<p>Performance is a quantifiable metric that is observed in teaching or practice.</p>
<p>Performance is not a valid metric to determine if learning is occuring.</p>
<p>Storage strength defines how interassociated a representation of memory is to relevant experiences &#40;such as knowledge or skills&#41;.</p>
<p>Learning is the idea of creating permanent changes in one&#39;s understanding or knowledge regarding a particular subject.</p>
<p>Factors that quickly improve retrieval strength are different from those that improve storage strength. If learners mistake retrieval strength as storage strength, a learner could mistakenly be led to believe that situations which improve retrieval strength could improve storage strength.</p>

<p>Difficulties which can encourage learning: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Varied learning conditions as opposed to constant and predictable ones.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interleaving instruction on separate topics together.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spacing study sessions on a given topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using tests as study events. &#91;1&#93;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning how to learn is the ultimate survival tool. </p>
<p>Rather do not fret over inputs but rather, output. Consolidate reading material from memory. Get with others to drill one another with questions. Activites that test your ability to generate explications yields more robust learning experiences.</p>
<p>Memory does not function like a video recorder. Reviewing the same material ad nauseam is not effective for memory. Learning involves attaching novel information to what is known by oneself. </p>
<p>Generating an explanation about a topic rather than just being given a solution can be more effective than the spacing effect. This is called the generation effect.</p>
<p>Learning difficulties which are desirable trigger encoding and retrieval processes that support storage strength. If the learner is unable to successfully handle presented difficulties, they become impediments rather than helps to learning.</p>
<p>Retrieval strength explains the ease in accessing a representation of a specific memory in the brain. It is signficantly affected by factors such as cues and recency of exposure to a material related to that representation.</p>
<p>Studying the same material in two different rooms rather the same room leads to increased recall of that material. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Interleaved practice produces higher quality prolonged retention and promotes skill transferability. In comparison to blocked practice and other sorts of mass practicing. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Blocked practice is deceptive; it is not the best form of learning though it can appear to be so. &#91;3&#93; </p>
<p>It is suggested that interleaving material forces one to differentiate between different topics. When pressured, this can heighten one&#39;s perception about differentiators. It leads to better embedding of abstractions that foster retention and transfer. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Participants in a motor skills test received 18 patterned trials via a pinball-like machine set-up. Participants were presented with randomly determined patterns &#40;interleaved&#41; or individual patterns that were practiced consecutively &#40;blocked&#41; on the machine. Blocked participants quickly improved versus interleaved participants. After a 10 day break, participants retested under blocked or interleaved conditions. Presented random conditions, the original interleaved participants performed superior to the blocked participants. Blocked participants appeared to have learned nothing. Presented blocked conditions, results were approximately the same but the minimal differences favored interleaving. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Testing is seen as a means of quantitative assessment but not for learning purposes. This is in contradiction to the fact that testing can be highly a highly beneficial tool for learning rather than a measurement of learning taking place. </p>
<p>8 and 12 year olds practiced tossing beanbags at a target on the floor while having their vision blocked at each throw. Half of each age group practiced throwing at a fixed distance target. The rest threw at targets of varying distances. After sufficient practices and a break, all children were tested under fixed target conditions for their age group. Children who practiced at variable distances performed better than fixed target participants. Introducing variation outmatched benefits of fixed distance practice. &#91;4&#93;</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##bibliography #harm #depression #social #media #factors #mental #illness ##health #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4.</p>

<p>The consideration of only monotonic effects were accounted. Relationships between digital media use and health are generally non-monotonic. Associations often follow a J-shaped curve. The first issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. This is nicknamed the Goldilocks hypothesis which was posited by Przybylski himself. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; A. K. Przybylski and N. Weinstein, &quot;A large-scale test of the goldilocks hypothesis: quantifying the relations between digital-screen use and the mental well-being of adolescents,&quot; Psychological Science, vol. 28, no. 2, pp. 204–215, 2017.</p>
<p>The global adolescent mental health crisis started around 2012 and greatly affects girls more so than boys &#91;5&#93;. As TV is now commonplace and TV watching amongst adolescents has declined after 2012 &#91;6&#93;, TV watching does not suggest an adequate explanation for the sudden increase in mental health disorders. The second issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;5&#93; S. McManus et al., &quot;Prevalence of non-suicidal self-harm and service contact in England, 2000–14: repeated cross-sectional surveys of the general population,&quot; The lancet psychiatry, vol. 6, no. 7, pp. 573–581, 2019. &#91;6&#93; J. M. Twenge, G. N. Martin, and B. H. Spitzberg, &quot;Trends in US Adolescents’ media use, 1976–2016: The rise of digital media, the decline of TV, and the &#40;near&#41; demise of print.,&quot; Psychology of Popular Media Culture, vol. 8, no. 4, p. 329, 2019.</p>
<p>The Monitoring the Future dataset examines digital media usage via two ways. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A minimal variance scale with labels that range from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;almost every day.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>A sufficiently varied count of weekly hours spent on digital media.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, Orben and Przybylski only included low-variance items. The fourth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; J. E. Schulenberg, L. D. Johnston, P. M. O’Malley, J. G. Bachman, R. A. Miech, and M. E. Patrick, &quot;Monitoring the Future national survey results on drug use, 1975-2016: Volume II, College students and adults ages 19-55,&quot; 2017.</p>
<p>Including controls that could in fact be mediators. The fifth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. Orben and Przybylski control for factors such as negative attitudes towards school, time spent with parents, parent distress and closeness to parents, which could be caused by heavy social media use. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4.</p>
<p>Using \(r^{2}\) for effect size has multiple problems. The sixth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; C. J. Ferguson, &quot;An effect size primer: a guide for clinicians and researchers.,&quot; 2016. &#91;2&#93; D. C. Funder and D. J. Ozer, &quot;Evaluating effect size in psychological research: Sense and nonsense,&quot; Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 156–168, 2019.</p>
<p>Heavy use of social media is regularly correlated with negative mental health outcomes of varying severity. This relationship disproportionately affects girls. Given that there is no plausible alternative explanation for this association, associations with a variety of adverse mental health conditions in girls should not be dismissed. Adverse events being rising rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; S. McManus et al., &quot;Prevalence of non-suicidal self-harm and service contact in England, 2000–14: repeated cross-sectional surveys of the general population,&quot; The lancet psychiatry, vol. 6, no. 7, pp. 573–581, &#91;1&#93; &#91;2&#93; J. M. Twenge, &quot;Why increases in adolescent depression may be linked to the technological environment,&quot; Current opinion in psychology, vol. 32, pp. 89–94, 2020.2019.</p>
<p>Effect sizes include many individual items. These are lower in internal reliability than multiple-item scales and thus produce lower effect sizes. Scales with more items count more heavily in the analysis because they have more items. &#91;1&#93; L. J. Cronbach and P. E. Meehl, &quot;Construct validity in psychological tests.,&quot; Psychological bulletin, vol. 52, no. 4, p. 281, 1955. The third issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski</p>
<p>Mediators are a possible reason behind an effect. They should not be controlled. This is from an email conversation with Jean Twenge about this issue. For example, it is plausible that excessive social media use causes teens to spend less time with their parents. Thus this variable should not be a covariate, as it might partially explain why the correlation between social media use and depression occurs in the first place. </p>

<p>In this particular study, a cohort of 971 individuals were involved in smoking cessation sessions hosted at smoking cessation clinics between 1986 and 1990. The intervention developed at these sessions for a participant involved attending eight 90 minute group sessions over a period of 4 months. The biggest of the groups reached 110 attendees. 3 months after a group quit date, 39.3&#37; of cohort self-reported as non-smoking. Thereafter, 32.1&#37; and 26.0&#37; of the cohort at 6 and 12 months respectively reported non-smoking. Finally, at an 8 year check-in, 33.9&#37; of the cohort were reached. 47.7&#37; reported not currently smoking &#40;16.2 of total cohort&#41;. &#91;pg. 725&#93;</p>
<p>33.9&#37; and 66.1&#37; of the cohort were male and female respectively. Participants averaged an age of 39.9. &#91;pg. 729&#93; Interestingly, it was found that the motivation for the cohort came from oneself with 81.2&#37; saying they wanted to quit. 3.4&#37; said they were motivated by others and 14.5&#37; said they were motivated by themselves and others. &#91;pg. 730&#93; The participants who were not successful in quitting smoking for 3 months reported not being prepared to quit. &#91;pg. 737&#93; The success rates that were reported were reasonably not significantly biased to positive or negative outcomes due to a loose balance between those who started with both <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05182020005014-smoking-recovery-indicators.md">great and poor quitting conditions</a> &#40;linked to related quitting factors&#41;. &#91;pg. 732&#93; Race was not accounted for in this study.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>Each session included topics such as education about the negative consequences of smoking, how to self monitor, and strategies for modifying behavior to disassociate smoking from pleasure. &quot;Butt jars&quot; were used to create aversive sensations to smoking via association with pictures of cancerous organs. In contrast, non-smoking behavior was rewarded in the idea of a &quot;money jar&quot;. The money jar contains the money a participant would have used for smoking and is instead set aside to be used to finance enjoyable activity. &#91;pg. 728&#93;</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The part of the study program most helpful to participants was the supportive nature of the large group setting. Despite large group sizes, individuals thought they were supported very well. The support and the accepting, non-judgemental atmosphere provided in groups promoted cessation. This study illustrated that a Cognitive Behavioral grounding in smoking cessation can produce success with large group participant. &#91;pg. 738&#93;</p>

<h3 id="rule-based_algorithm">Rule-based Algorithm</h3>
<p>The authors also decided to create a very simple rule-based algorithm in an effort to make results easily reproducible and understandable to researchers of differing backgrounds. This algorithm for assessing data quality was as is follows:</p>
<table><tr><th align="center">Number</th><th align="center">Rule</th><th align="center">Rationale</th></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">EDA is not within the range of \(0.05 - 60 \mu S\)</td><td align="center">Prevent &quot;floor&quot; and &quot;ceiling&quot; artifacts</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">EDA fluctuates too fast \((+/- 10 \frac{\mu S}{second})\)</td><td align="center">To prevent &quot;jump&quot; artifacts</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">Temperature not within 30-40 \(C\)</td><td align="center">Preserve best accuracy of data</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">EDA data within \(5\) sec of invalid sections</td><td align="center">Invalid sections based on rules \(1-3\)</td></tr></table>
<p>If the data did not adhere to these rules, it was classified as artifact. </p>
<h4 id="notes_on_algorithm_rules">Notes on Algorithm Rules</h4>
<p><em>1. In Rule 1, 60 was chosen as an upper limit specifically because that was the upper limit of the Q Sensor.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Rule 2&#39;s rationale came from &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93;</em></p>
<p><em>3. For Rule 3, their data recorded temperatures of 32 - 36 \(C\) consistently for individuals</em></p>
<h3 id="misc_notes">Misc Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>When collecting EDA data, the authors used solid conductive adhesive hydrogel Ag/AgCl electrodes &#40;22 mm square; model A10040-5 from Vermed; Buffalo, NY&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Used 181 hours worth of data collected from children and adolescents with autism in an at-home environment.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> March 29 2020</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Takeaways from the book How to Take Smart Notes</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##bibliography #knowledge #notetaking #zettelkasten #mentalmodels #writing #blog #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>S. Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Quotes from the Book:</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>This was overall a book on knowledge management – in particular, how to take, digest, and use the notes we make while reading material, listening to lectures, or absorb knowledge in general. Sonke Ahrens, the author of the book, also gave a rather in-depth overview of the Zettelkasten method created by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. I found the book useful in giving legitimately very good advice on note-taking, great anecdotes to illustrate his point, and also assistance on using the Zettelkasten method. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Ahrens made an interesting point saying that if you are approaching writing where you start with just a blank page, you are missing the point. When you approach a blank page, it <em>ought</em> not feel blank but rather the place to put your notes and ideas together that you have been collecting about a particular topic. Ahrens believes that fundamental teachings about how to write long-form papers are wrong in that they do not start with the most crucial aspect of the writing process – free form thought. And free form thought, when investigating a topic, is best captured using a global sort of note taking method like the Zettelkasten.</p>
<h3 id="quotes_from_the_book">Quotes from the Book:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-julia">&quot;Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note&quot; &#91;pg 8&#93;&quot;We only write if it helps us with our own thinking.&quot; &#91;pg 101&#93;</code></pre>
<p>These two quotes get at the idea that when we write and create notes, we are not only creating notes but also playing with ideas and digesting them into our minds.</p>

<p>They had a small cohort of nine individuals working at a call center using skin conductance sensors to measure EDA. They used exponential smoothing and chose a smoothing factor, \(\alpha\), of \(0.8\) – it was unclear why this was chosen. They also elected to normalize the skin conductance signals on each individual between \(0\) and \(1\) to reduce variability between the cohort members. </p>
