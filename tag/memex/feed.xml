<h3 id="the_failure_of_the_publication_machine">The Failure of the Publication Machine</h3>
<p>Publication has been extended beyond usefulness of the record. Current methods for finding relevant information is impractical.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: Very convicting retrospection on how we handle copious amounts of information. A record which contains too little information is not informative and one that contains too much is overwhelming.</em></p>
<p>Those who try to stay current with research may have difficulty to recall last month&#39;s material studied.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: This is so convicting&#33; Even though it is a nearly 80 year old paper, the problems that he discusses are still in existence&#33;  The problem of having too many papers and the inability to extract the truly worthwhile pieces of information are still present.</em></p>
<h3 id="the_idea_of_automated_knowledge_systems">The idea of Automated Knowledge Systems</h3>
<p>When one associates information along logical processes, creativity is limited to data selection to match a process. After this initial surge of creativity, the work is fit for automation</p>
<h3 id="regarding_thought">Regarding Thought</h3>
<p>There exist no substitute for nuanced thinking. Imagination and repetitious thinking are diverse. Repetitive thought is much easier automated.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: I like this notion of repetitive thought. As much as there are repetitive thought, there are repetitive actions accordingly.</em></p>
