<h3 id="quotes_regarding_knowledge">Quotes Regarding Knowledge</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are known knowns; there are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns; that is to say, there are things that we now know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns — there are things we do not know we don’t know.&quot; - Secretary of State, Donald Rumsfeld</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot; - Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An inductive approach to knowledge that Sherlock Holmes takes to solve puzzles and problems.</p>
<h3 id="quotes_regarding_books">Quotes Regarding Books</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book&quot; - Oscar Wilde, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04202022021854-picture-dorian-gray.md">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote gets at how the influence of a book can corrupt an individual or push someone further to corruption. In Gray&#39;s case, he was already corrupted but the book further pushed him beyond what evil he was already capable of pursuing.</p>
<h3 id="quotes_regarding_fame">Quotes Regarding Fame</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot; - Oscar Wilde, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04202022021854-picture-dorian-gray.md">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you attain fame, at least you are talked about – whether positively or negatively. But to not be talked about means no one even knows who you are.</p>
