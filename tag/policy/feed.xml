<p>G. P. Guy et al., &quot;Association of State-Issued Mask Mandates and Allowing On-Premises Restaurant Dining with County-Level COVID-19 Case and Death Growth Rates — United States, March 1–December 31, 2020,&quot; MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep., vol. 70, no. 10, pp. 350–354, Mar. 2021, doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm7010e3.</p>

<h3 id="definitions_and_background">Definitions and Background</h3>
<p><strong>State-issued mask mandates:</strong> Required to wear masks at:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>Businesses and food establishments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>State-issued restaurant closures:</strong> Restaurants not operating or restricting service to takeout, curbside pickup, or delivery. </p>
<p><strong>Providing indoor or outdoor on-premises dining:</strong> State lifting a restaurant closure. No distinction was made on how restaurants reopened &#40;such as with reduced capacity, enhanced sanitation, etc.&#41;. Per states, if a bar served food, it was coded as a restaurant and if a bar did not serve food, there were bars.</p>
<h3 id="equations">Equations</h3>
<p>&#40;1&#41; Daily growth rate : </p>
\[
\ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - \ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - 1 * 100
\]
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>Analyses were weighted by county population; standard errors were robust to heteroscedasticity; clustered by state. </p>
<p>Relationship between policies and COVID-19 measured 1–20 days prior to implementation compared with seven mutually exclusive time ranges post-implementation. Associations were examined 60 - 41 and 40 - 21 days before implementation and 1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days after implementation.</p>
<p>COVID-19 case and death growth rates were compared via weighted least-squares regression with county and day fixed effects. Four regression models were used for associating mandates and COVID-19 growth rates by controlling for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restaurant closures in mask mandate models</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mask mandates in the restaurant reopening models</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bar closures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay-at-home orders</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bans on gatherings of &gt;&#61; 10 persons</p>
</li>
<li><p>Daily COVID-19 tests per 100000 persons</p>
</li>
<li><p>County</p>
</li>
<li><p>Day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QUESTION: I wonder how they controlled for these covariate variables?</em></p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates over these day ranges post-mask mandate implementation were seen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Permitting on-premises dining saw increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates</p>
<ul>
<li><p>41 - 60</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>days after reopening.</p>
<p>Increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates were observed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>days after reopening.</p>
<p>During March 1–December 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied in 2,313 &#40;73.6&#37;&#41; of the 3,142 U.S. counties. Post mask mandate COVID case growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20 days: -0.5&#37; &#40;p &#61; 0.02&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40 days: -1.1&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60 days: -1.5&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80 days: -1.7&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 -100 days: -1.8&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Post mask mandate COVID death growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20 days: -0.7&#37; &#40;p &#61; 0.03&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40 days: -1.0&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60 days: -1.4&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80 days: -1.6&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 -100 days: -1.9&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QUESTION: Oh so does this suggest that it took about 20 days before we started to see the lagging effects of these mandates?</em></p>
<p>After &gt; 40 days on-premises dining was permitted, increases in case and death growth rates were observed. Possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restaurants may have delayed reopening after on-premises dining allowed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restaurant patrons cautious at reopen but grew bolder as time passed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Models not control for other policies like: other types of business closures, physical distancing recommendations, policies issued by localities, and county-level policy variances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Policy compliance and enforcement not explored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No differentiating indoor and outdoor dining, ventilation, and following physical distancing and occupancy not investigated.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="study_purpose">Study Purpose</h3>
<p>Examined whether implementation of statewide mask mandates was associated with COVID-19–associated hospitalization growth rates among different age groups.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Statewide mask mandate:</strong> persons operating in a personal capacity must wear a mask</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>At businesses and in restaurants &amp; food establishments</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>COVID-NET Site:</strong> Group of counties within a state. Sites in states that did not have statewide mask mandates during March 1– October 17, 2020, were excluded from the analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Nonpharmaceutical Interventions &#40;NPIs&#41;:</strong> Actions taken to slow the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<h3 id="data_source">Data Source</h3>
<p><strong>COVID-NET:</strong> population-based surveillance system &#91;1&#93; that provides laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in 99 counties located in 14 states, beginning March 1, 2020 &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>For analyses, cumulative hospitalization rates for each week of the study period for seven age cohorts &#40;adults aged 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years&#41; were aggregated into three age groups &#40;18–39, 40–64, and ≥65 years&#41;.</p>
<p>Weekly cumulative hospitalization growth rate &#40;HGrowthast&#41; for age cohort a in site s during week t is defined as the weekly percentage change in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 persons, estimated by HGrowth<em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; &#40;&#40;log &#40;HR</em>&#123;ast&#125;&#41;-log &#40;HR<em>&#123;as&#40;t-1&#41;&#125;&#41;&#41;×100, where HR</em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population for age cohort a in site s in week t.

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>For 40-64 year-olds, 2 weeks after statewide mask mandates: weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 2.9&#37;.</p>
<p>For 40-64, 18 - 39 year-olds, &gt;&#61; 3 weeks after statewide mask mandates: weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 5.5&#37;.</p>

<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Points of Interest</li><li>Counterfactual Mobility Network</li><li>Limitations</li><li>Conclusions</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>Iterative proportional fitting &#91;1&#93; was used to make POI –&gt; <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/01202021043013-census-groups">CBG</a> networks from SafeGraph data. SafeGraph mobility data was validated against Google mobility data.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: What is iterative proportional fitting?</em></p>
<p>Model fits observed daily case counts from 8 March to 9 May 2020</p>
<h3 id="points_of_interest">Points of Interest</h3>
<p>POI hourly infection rate determined via:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Area</p>
</li>
<li><p>Median visit duration</p>
</li>
<li><p>Time-varying density of infectious individuals</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Three free time-invariant parameters that scale:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>POI transmission rates</p>
</li>
<li><p>CBG transmission rates</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initial amount of exposed individuals</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Points of interest for this paper are such as: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Restaurants</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grocery stores</p>
</li>
<li><p>Religious establishments</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Certain categories of POIs contributed far more to infections like restaurants and hotels The model predicted time-dependent variation - likely due to policy change.</p>
<p>Model can identify at-risk populations and determined that disadvantaged racial socioeconomic groups face higher rates of infection.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: This conclusion seems very obvious – of course people are going to have to move and keep doing things.</em></p>
<h3 id="counterfactual_mobility_network">Counterfactual Mobility Network</h3>
<p>Counterfactual mobility network creation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Scaling magnitude of mobility reduction down</p>
</li>
<li><p>Positioning the model at different times</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apply model to counterfactual networks to simulate infection trajectories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: What is a counterfactual network? I wonder in what sense they are using the word &quot;counterfactual&quot;?</em></p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>Limitations of dataset:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some populations missing</p>
</li>
<li><p>All POIs not ID&#39;d</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does not break up CBGs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The model is sparse.  It does not include all real-world disease transmission variables.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>COVID-19 superspreader events &#91;2&#93;–&#91;5&#93; motivate risk modeling. Infection rates among different people groups &#91;6&#93;–&#91;12&#93; require modeling effects of the virus on disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The observed disparity was driven by a few POIs. Majority of infections from small fraction of superspreader POIs.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably because they cannot work from home as easily.&quot; &#91;10&#93;</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: It almost feels insulting that after this entire analysis, there is only one footnote on the topic of what people actually experience. On the flip side, I can empathize where a research group could lack time and/or means to contextualize results. Either way, it feels ripe to build on top of this work/paper to better examine the actual effects of policy adjustments and life changes.</em></p>
<p>CBGs with fewer white residents had higher predicted infection risks.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: Seems somewhat odd? This is interesting to me in how they keep bringing up race or economic status as a variable, but never fully commit to an investigation. Feels really weird to talk about issues without actually addressing them.</em></p>
<p>Mobility data showed average grocery store visits from lower-income CBGs had 59&#37; more hourly visitors per square foot. Median metro area data showed they stayed 17&#37; longer.</p>
