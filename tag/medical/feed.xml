<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I was suggested this paper by Sarah Gasman of Boston Medical Center. She suggested it as has it holds great relevance to some of my research on health disparities. I must say, this paper was revelatory and plan a future discussion with the study authors due to how incredible it was to my mind.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_intersectionality">What Is Intersectionality?</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11042022141714-what-intersectionality-theory">What Is Intersectionality and Intersectionality Theory?</a> - An overview and summary on what is intersectionality and intersectionality theory as an area of health and health disparities research.</p>
<h3 id="why_are_intersectional_approaches_needed">Why Are Intersectional Approaches Needed?</h3>
<p>Prior literature has shown multiple examples where an understanding of intersectionality is useful in a health context: 	- Racism, sexism, and classism are interlocking, mutually constituted, and reinforcing &#40;Collins 2000; Crenshaw 1991; Dill and Zambrana 2009&#41; 	- Effects of racial, gender, and socioeconomic stratification are nonadditive &#40;meaning that racial, gender, and socioeconomic aspects do not all equally contribute to problems in intersectionality &#91;e.g. gender could have more impact than race considerations in certain situations&#93;&#41;. 	It was observed that the greatest racial inequalities in health were found among women and furthermore seen among those women with higher levels of socioeconomic status &#40;Brown et al. 2016; Cummings and Jackson 2008; Warner and Brown 2011&#41;.</p>
<h3 id="how_is_health_impacted_by_intersectionality">How Is Health Impacted by Intersectionality?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Intersectionality highlights the possible synergistic effects of inequality on populations &#40;Choo and Ferree 2010; McCall 2005&#41;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Health is simultaneously shaped by an array of individual-level social positions &#40;Brown et al. 2016; Hargrove 2018; Schulz and Mullings 2006&#41;. 	- Health disparities at the intersection of race and gender can be covered by unidimensional health research. 	They can overlook the unique experiences of women of color and the multiple forms of oppression that impact one&#39;s life &#40;Bowleg 2012; King 1988; Weber 2010&#41;. 	- The relationship between socioeconomic status &#40;SES&#41; and health is racialized. 	Education, income, and wealth seem to be less protective for the health of blacks compared to whites &#40;Assari 2018; Boen, Keister, and Aronson 2020; Colen, Krueger, and Boettner 2018; Hudson et al. 2013&#41;. 	- Attributing perceived interpersonal discrimination to categories &#40;e.g., race, gender, class, and others&#41; is associated with worse health outcomes &#40;Grollman 2012, 2014&#41;.</p>
<h3 id="how_can_intersectionality_help_address_health_inequity">How Can Intersectionality Help Address Health Inequity?</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Intersectionality highlights social inequalities in many facets of society, across socially constructed groups, and how social inequalities are not caused by social statuses or identities per se but from systems of oppression &#40;Cho, Crenshaw, and McCall 2013&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Intersectionality demonstrates how social inequalities are shaped by a confluence of factors often obscured by unidimensional approaches &#40;Dill and Zambrana 2009; McCall 2005&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Intersectionality underscores utility of examining systems within and between social contexts &#40;Choo and Ferree 2010&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Intersectionality highlights the complex nature of the social world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Intersectionality research itself is characterized by its complexity.</p>

<p>Denied claims are medical claims that an insurer determined they did not need to pay after processing. The denial can be for many reasons ranging from clerical errors in the coding or submission process to breaches of the patient-payer contract. These denied claims are sent back to the biller with an Explanation of Benefits or Electronic Remittance Advice which both explain why the claim was denied and how to potentially appeal the denial. &#91;1&#93;</p>

<p>In general, there are <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12092021203839-types-claims">several different types of claims</a>.</p>
<p>The following diagram depicts how data is generated and passed through a medical billing process:</p>

<p>Here, the green blocks representing medical staff and patients, denote where data originates from. Whenever a medical staffer provides or a patient seeks a medical service, data is generated &#40;these encounters could be routine health check-ups, emergency room visits, or anything involving an interaction with a medical service provider&#41;. These services are then recorded and passed along to medical coders whose job it is to match a service provided with a correct standardized medical code &#40;standards include coding such as ICD-10, HCPCS, etc&#41;. After these services are matched to a correct standard, the coded services are then passed on to a medical biller who determines what is covered by a patient&#39;s insurance and what is not. Depending on what is or is not covered, this claims data then passes to insurance providers in a back and forth process to adequately pay for the services utilized by the patient and patients may also be directly be billed for services leading to potentially either return visits or these claims to be appealed by the patient.</p>

<p>The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership &#40;OMOP&#41; was created in 2009 to reach consensus on data types, study designs, and privacy concerns while sharing data.</p>
<p>The ground truth for OMOP investigations were positive and negative tests regarding drugs. Examples of positive controls were:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Events on drug label warnings/precautions
- If it was a causative agenda</code></pre>
<p>Examples of negative controls were:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Events not listed on drug labels
- No powered studies with evidence of potential positive association</code></pre>
