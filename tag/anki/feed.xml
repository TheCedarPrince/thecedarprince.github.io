<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Recently, I was sharing with a few online communities &#40;namely the Neorg and Anki Discord Servers&#41; my success with Anki. I was somewhat surprised at how many people were both curious and excited about what I was up to and how I was learning things with Anki. After writing up some advice across the servers, I decided it best to coalesce my thoughts here on how I use Anki for mathematics, languages, and incremental reading.</p>
<h3 id="how_to_get_started_with_anki">How To Get Started with Anki</h3>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki is perhaps one of the greatest learning tools made</a>. To quickly summarize, Anki is a software for creating digital flashcards and then quizzes you throughout the day, everyday on cards according to how well you can recall each card.  To get started with Anki, here are some tips I would give to myself if I had to start over again and to anyone curious about getting started with Anki:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Skim the official Anki documentation</strong>: Familiarize yourself with Anki&#39;s features and functionalities by skimming through the official Anki documentation available at <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html">Anki Getting Started</a>. &#40;Another good reference, although unofficial and may become outdated, is: <a href="https://leananki.com/how-to-use-anki-tutorial/">How to Use Anki</a> by Lean Anki&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Start with simple cards</strong>: Begin your Anki journey by creating straightforward flashcards to ensure better comprehension and recall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic and cloze default templates are great to use and cover a wide range of use cases you may have.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gradually increase the number of new cards per day</strong>: I would not recommend several new cards a day as you get started.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you start with 100 new cards on day one, that means the next day you would have to study 100 new cards AND 100 reviews of your day old new cards at minimum. In practice, this will hike up your number of reviews between the two days to well over 300 cards potentially.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Using Pre-made decks is OK</strong>: If you are unsure about how to make decks or are low on time, you can <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">use pre-made decks</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Learning deck options can be quite helpful...</strong>: In particular, settings like <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html">Daily Limits, Display Order, Timer, and Subdecks</a> are worth learning about as a beginner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This can help prevent feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>...but, Stick with the default algorithm settings</strong>: Avoid unnecessary tinkering and utilize Anki&#39;s default algorithm, which is designed for optimal card review timing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are Deck Options like New Cards, Lapses, or other Advanced fields and scheduling. <sup id="fnref:1">[1]</sup></p>
<p>To emphasize the last point, while there are numerous Anki resources offering &quot;best settings for success&quot; such as on YouTube or blog posts &#40;even this one – go do Anki&#33;&#41;, be cautious not to get caught up in <a href="https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2022/productivity-porn/">&quot;productivity porn&quot;</a>.  Focus on consistent usage of Anki and trust in the effectiveness of the default scheduler and most of the review settings. </p>
<h3 id="effective_anki_philosophies">Effective Anki Philosophies</h3>
<p>These are philosophies I have found useful when I work with Anki. Feel free to incorporate, ignore, or use them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Add content you want to learn</strong>: Only add content to Anki you truly, genuinely want to learn – ask yourself, &quot;Am I comfortable with reviewing this content over the next year?&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you even hesitate a moment, <strong>DO NOT ADD IT</strong>. <sup id="fnref:2">[2]</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>When you have dead time...</strong>: Waiting in a line for a tea at a cafe?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Review Anki. Have a break between a PvP session while playing Destiny 2? Review Anki. Stationary biking at the gym? Review Anki.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>One card, one fact</strong>: Keep one fact per review card you make.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Follow the 20 principles of knowledge formulation</strong>: Read the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation">20 Rules of Knowledge Formulation</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn, live, ~~loathe~~ love it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;C-m3RtoguAQ">&quot;I... Declare... Bankruptcy&#33;&#33;&#33;&quot; – Michael Scott, King of Anki</a></strong>: If you are feeling overwhelmed by how many reviews you have to do each day, it is alright to declare what I call &quot;Anki Bankruptcy&quot; and temporarily stop adding new cards to review each day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do this until you feel more motivated or your review count is back to a comfortable level. <sup id="fnref:3">[3]</sup></p>
<h3 id="other_personal_strategies">Other Personal Strategies</h3>
<p>These are my highly personal review strategies. They may be wrong, but they help me consistently manage all my Anki reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Embrace a simplified review process</strong>: Streamline your card reviews by focusing solely on the &quot;good&quot; or &quot;again&quot; key, simplifying decision-making and promoting efficient learning.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prioritize well-being and take breaks</strong>: Ensure your physical and mental well-being by prioritizing breaks and engaging in activities that rejuvenate you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Adjust Deck Settings</strong>: Create different deck profiles, such as &quot;Hard Studies&quot; for challenging subjects or &quot;No New Cards&quot; when you need a temporary break.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly review statistics</strong>: I monitor my progress by reviewing Anki&#39;s statistics every day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps me track performance and if I may need to reduce or increase the intensity of my recent Anki sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organize with decks and subdecks</strong>: I categorize my flashcards into decks and subdecks based on subjects or topics of interest broadly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what_about_add-ons">What about Add-Ons?</h4>
<p>I do use a couple Anki Add-ons&#33; I tend to more focus on aesthetics and statistics for my Anki set-up. Here are some that I always use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/308574457">Anki-redesign</a> - A new lightweight look for Anki</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/738807903">More Overview Stats 2.1</a> - This addon adds more information to the deck overview statistics.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1556734708">More Decks Stats and Time Left</a> - This addon shows extra information of the due cards and returns the expected time to finalize &#40;Due&#43;New&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083">Review Heatmap</a> - Adds a heatmap graph to Anki&#39;s main window which visualizes past and future card review activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advanced_techniques">Advanced Techniques</h3>
<p>These are advanced techniques that I am experimenting with. Reader be warned&#33;</p>
<h4 id="incremental_understanding">Incremental Understanding</h4>
<p>I didn&#39;t find Anki particularly well-suited for <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Incremental_reading">Incremental Reading</a> and instead created an iterative process I call &quot;Incremental Understanding&quot;. What the process entails is this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I pull content from what I read such as a paragraph or a few lines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each chunk of information, I add that to a card that only has three sections: the content, associated thoughts, and their reference.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As I review each of these cards, I edit them into my own language. &#40;I max out how much I spend on each card per review to 3 minutes&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>I repeat steps 1 - 3, until each card I feel is sufficiently described in my own language and then I suspend and tag the card for transfer into my personal notes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each note that is tagged for transfer, I then move and stitch them into my personal notes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To make steps 3 and 4 easier, I use the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1429363228">Tag Toggler Add On</a>. For 5, this is an intentionally manual process that, although labor intensive, forces me to think how this new content fits into my knowledge base and any existing notes I have.</p>
<h4 id="anki_for_mathematics">Anki for Mathematics?</h4>
<p>It&#39;s an evolving process, but I have written a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/01072023041127-making-math-anki/">separate dedicated blog post</a> dedicated to the processes I have been developing for this.</p>
<h3 id="concluding_thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h3>
<p>I hope this small guide on getting started with and using Anki was helpful&#33; Again, these are my own personal notes and takes on how to use the tool. To that end, if you have any suggestions, thoughts, or feedback, please let me know&#33;</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>A major goal in my life is to get better with studying maths. As I fully intend to study mathematics more rigorously, a powerful component and tool in my studying toolbox has been Spaced Repetition Systems like Anki or Memrise. In particular, I wanted to know how to use these sort of systems to study and retain math more effectively in my studies – which sometimes face unexpected interruptions. This post serves as a guide to do just that.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>TODO: Add this discussion into here How I operate is that Anki is a supplement to my learning and not the whole piece. For example, I use Anki to learn definitions and their properties, but then when I work on proofs, I usually scribble that down into my notes and then try my best at linking together different definitions until I have something pleasant. &#91;11:51 AM&#93;TheCedarPrince: I say “linking” intentionally as my notes are stored within a Zettelkasten where each of the definitions I’ve learned are also found. So then I weave together the notes quickly into longer form pieces or proofs or what have you &#91;11:52 AM&#93;TheCedarPrince: Let me know if you have any questions — happy to hear your thoughts&#33;</p>
<h3 id="principles_in_making_anki_cards_for_maths">Principles in Making Anki Cards for Maths</h3>
<p>These principles are curated specifically to think about maths and Anki:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Anki is a complement to learning – it is not the whole process of learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With maths, it is required to sit down, to struggle, and fully work through concepts. Anki is at best a complement to help you remember what you have learned or know.  At worst, a distraction that one ends up frustrated with as one is not seeing the progress they want to see.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Add small pieces that are worth remembering to Anki.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020031618-zettelkasten-principles">Anki pieces as atomic as possible &#40;see the linked note and think of them as Anki cards instead of &quot;zettels&quot;&#41;</a>. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Be brutally honest in marking an Anki review. &#91;1&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Good cards lead to good results – take the time on making good cards. &#91;1&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>If having problems with a certain topic or set of questions, break the topic down to the smallest components possible to better understand the overall topic. &#91;2&#93;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Identify the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07082020163004-ultralearning">facts, procedures, and concepts</a> and try to use those in creating smaller supplementary cards to help you with a concept. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<h3 id="card_types">Card Types</h3>
<p>In maths, there are many different types of things to learn. Accordingly, there are a few different types of cards that are useful to make this learning process easier.</p>
<h4 id="definitions">Definitions</h4>
<p>In learning definitions, some useful principles to keep in mind in constructing Anki cards that test definitions are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A definition can usually be broken down across the following parts:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- The object to be defined
- Its descriptor &#40;this is a unique definition for this object&#41;
- Notation conventions for this object
- Properties associated with the object 
- Any context that the object may be associated with &#40;e.g. when exploring a set, are we talking about sets with in ZFC Set Theory or within the category of &#36;Set&#36;?&#41; &#91;4&#93;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>There can be many different definitions for the same object</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- In this case, create different cards for each different definition</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Use clozes liberally to study each part of a given definition &#91;5&#93;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: Include example note outline here</p>
<h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>
<p>TODO: Add what I have learned about property cards TODO: Include example note outline here </p>
<h4 id="theorems">Theorems</h4>
<p>As identified in &#91;4&#93;, there are typically two types of theorems: <em>Implication Only</em> and <em>Implication and Equivalency</em>.</p>
<h5 id="implication_only_theorems">Implication Only Theorems</h5>
<p><em>Implication Only</em> theorems have the quality that the conditions associated with that particular theorem, when satisfied, imply specific conclusions. Similar to making cards for definitions, there are some principles that can be followed for these sorts of cards:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An <em>Implication Only</em> theorem can be broken down across the following parts:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- The theorem name to be defined
- Its descriptor &#40;the definition for this theorem&#41;
- Any context that the theorem may be associated with 
- Notation conventions for this object
- Conditions of the theorem
- Conclusions from this theorem</code></pre>
<h5 id="implication_and_equivalence_theorems">Implication and Equivalence Theorems</h5>
<p><em>Implication and Equivalence</em> theorems possess the virtue where if an associated set of conditions are met, imply that two or more arbitrary statements can be equivalent. &#91;4&#93; Making cards for this type of theorem is almost identical to making cards for definitions. The only key difference is that one should also add fields for the equivalent statements that result from this theorem.</p>
<h3 id="self_testing">Self Testing</h3>
<p>TODO: Add section based on question cards  TODO: Include example note outline here</p>
<h3 id="the_ankification_of_proofs">The &quot;Ankification&quot; of Proofs</h3>
<p>Michael Nielsen wrote an excellent piece on this process called <a href="https://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics">&quot;Using spaced repetition systems to see through a piece of mathematics&quot;</a>.  Basically, he proposes the use of Anki to deeply understand and study proofs. Personally for me, I am not yet confident in an approach to draft proofs in Anki form. I <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/01162023063211-ankification-proofs">took notes on Nielsen&#39;s &quot;Ankification&quot; and processing of a proof</a> and am including some digested thoughts he had on working through proofs.</p>
<h4 id="initial_glances_of_a_proof">Initial Glances of a Proof</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Pick out single elements of a proof</p>
</li>
<li><p>Convert these elements to Anki cards</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you pick out these elements and create cards, they may be able to be formulated into definition cards. Or, they may be needed to become their own special sort of card or fact – anything that can help in the learning process.</p>
<h4 id="building_out_a_conceptual_roadmap_of_a_proof">Building Out a Conceptual Roadmap of a Proof</h4>
<p>A proof is not a linear list of statements.  Per Nielsen, it is much more valuable to think of it as relationships between simple observations.  Each of these connections between observations are not just made for no reason. Rather, determine how to find multiple ways to think of the same observation or come to the same observation that is useful for a proof. At this stage, we are beginning to learn our way comfortably around a proof and finding multiple ways to get to each step in a proof is imperative in building that comfort.</p>
<h4 id="consider_the_alternatives_of_a_proof">Consider the Alternatives of a Proof</h4>
<p>Once you have built significant comfort with a proof, keep considering different aspects of the proof. Consider the alternatives within this proof – if this assumption were changed or that context was altered, what are the ramifications of this proof? This process can continue endlessly but should only stop when you are wholly confident in your understandings of a give proof.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>To conclude, this short guide is by no means exhaustive. Instead, I made this as a short reference for myself in studying maths using a spaced repetition learning process. I&#39;ll certainly come back to revise this as I continue to work and go through the maths I study to share what works for me.</p>
