<p>I read a Q&amp;A article on Barbara Liskov &#91;1&#93; and the author made a very interesting comparison between Liskov&#39;s work of designing paradigms for creating well structured and crafted code with that of a Poet or Novelist. I have heard of comparisons like this before but I was quite intrigued by the latter – a programmer being compared to a writer. What piqued my interest the most about the article was the following statement,</p>
<p>&quot;As a computer scientist thinking about code, Liskov had no physical objects to work with. Like a novelist or a poet, <em>she was staring at a blank page</em>.&quot; &#40;emphasis added&#41;</p>
<p>The end of that statement, &quot;<em>blank page</em>&quot;, reminded me of the book <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em> &#91;2&#93; and my note on the book where Ahrens essentially believes that starting with a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03292020180520-smart-notes.md">blank page is the wrong idea in writing</a>. I wonder if the same could be true about programming. In effect, does a global approach to building software make more sense than to artificially package each and every piece of software separately? Could an approach like the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020031549-zettelkasten.md">Zettelkasten method</a> where, according to its <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020031618-zettelkasten-principles.md">principles</a>, each thought is kept to itself and then linked to different associated pieces of knowledge, map to software development?</p>
<p>Upon reflection upon this note some time later, I think I was thinking about the concept of composition and composition of software&#33;</p>
