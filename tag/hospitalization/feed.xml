<h3 id="study_purpose">Study Purpose</h3>
<p>Examined whether implementation of statewide mask mandates was associated with COVID-19–associated hospitalization growth rates among different age groups.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Statewide mask mandate:</strong> persons operating in a personal capacity must wear a mask</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>At businesses and in restaurants &amp; food establishments</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>COVID-NET Site:</strong> Group of counties within a state. Sites in states that did not have statewide mask mandates during March 1– October 17, 2020, were excluded from the analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Nonpharmaceutical Interventions &#40;NPIs&#41;:</strong> Actions taken to slow the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<h3 id="data_source">Data Source</h3>
<p><strong>COVID-NET:</strong> population-based surveillance system &#91;1&#93; that provides laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in 99 counties located in 14 states, beginning March 1, 2020 &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>For analyses, cumulative hospitalization rates for each week of the study period for seven age cohorts &#40;adults aged 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years&#41; were aggregated into three age groups &#40;18–39, 40–64, and ≥65 years&#41;.</p>
<p>Weekly cumulative hospitalization growth rate &#40;HGrowthast&#41; for age cohort a in site s during week t is defined as the weekly percentage change in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 persons, estimated by HGrowth<em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; &#40;&#40;log &#40;HR</em>&#123;ast&#125;&#41;-log &#40;HR<em>&#123;as&#40;t-1&#41;&#125;&#41;&#41;×100, where HR</em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population for age cohort a in site s in week t. The log of the cumulative hospitalization growth rate is similar to the log of the cumulative cases per week, as the denominators are equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>For 40-64 year-olds, 2 weeks after statewide mask mandates: weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 2.9&#37;.</p>
<p>For 40-64, 18 - 39 year-olds, &gt;&#61; 3 weeks after statewide mask mandates: weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 5.5&#37;.</p>
<p><em>QUESTION: How were these age groupings made I wonder?</em></p>
