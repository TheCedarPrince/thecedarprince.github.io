<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>These are some best practices found across a variety of resources that describe how to structure an observational health study.</p>
<h3>Things To Do</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Pre-specify elements of an observational study such as its:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Design</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parameters</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things_to_avoid">Things To Avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Do not evolve your approach for a desired result</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This can happen consciously or unconsciously</p>
</li>
<li><p>Known as p-hacking</p>
</li>
<li><p>Real world data can give the feeling of limitless opportunities</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Could lead to unclear lines of inquiry</p>
</li>
<li><p>Difficult to explain</p>
</li>
<li><p>Harder to reproduce</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above avoidance suggestions does have some strong caveats however. In the context of a network study, there exists a tension between the idealized, &quot;in theory&quot; idea of a study design and the &quot;in practice&quot; study design. In practice, an idealized design may fail, not scientifically, but due to implementation details that were not foreseen. Furthermore, when considering an international audience, there could even be a serious design failure when not considering regional or country level differences.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>This small blog post gives a very high level overview of a paper I authored on developing phenotype definitions which are computable and robust to a disease being examined.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06504">This paper is vailable on arXiv under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license</a>.  Please <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/resources/">reach out to me</a> if you have any issues accessing this paper and I will send you a PDF&#33;</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>While working on some of my notes one day, I realized I had the beginnings of a paper&#33; In particular, I was working on a note about <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//01072021074632-computable-phenotypes">computable phenotypes</a> and thinking about <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//01022021031334-all-payer-claims">All Payer Claims Databases</a>. Additionally, I am in the course of a current endeavor built on a study I conducted last year called, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7779877"><em>A Pilot Characterization Study Assessing Health Equity in Mental Healthcare Delivery within the State of Georgia</em></a> which has made me think strongly about the whole concept of developing definitions of disease.</p>
<p>It just so happened while I was thinking about these ideas, my Georgia Tech Research Institute colleague, Dr. Shenita Freeman, let me know about an upcoming IEEE conference, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230325190023/http://2023.cbms-conference.org/"><em>2023 IEEE Computer Based Medical Systems conference</em></a>. We both took a look at the opportunity and saw that a paper about computable phenotypes as well as the overall notion of phenotype definitions was a good idea for the conference. I reached out to some collaborators and we were off on writing this paper&#33;</p>
<h3 id="whats_the_purpose_about_this_paper">What&#39;s the Purpose about This Paper?</h3>
<p>What if I told you, how we, as researchers, speak about disease is, wrong – or at least, not quite accurate? For example, if I tell you, &quot;I research diabetes&#33;&quot;, well that is great and a noble cause but that doesn&#39;t help with telling people what it is that you are <em>actually</em> doing. As any diabetic knows, there is a huge difference between Type I Diabetes and Type II Diabetes and that doesn&#39;t consider other species of diabetes such as gestational diabetes, etc. So, it seems to me, that we need some sort of rigorous way to talk about disease, right?</p>
<p>Yes&#33; Many researchers over the years have been defining what are called <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//01072021074632-computable-phenotypes">&quot;phenotypes&quot;</a> which can be things like disease diagnoses &#40;such as Type II Diabetes&#41; and lab measurements &#40;like blood glucose, HbA1C, etc.&#41;. Then, we can build upon these phenotypes into what is called a &quot;phenotype definition&quot;. Simply put, these are a set of instructions that tells us <em>how</em> we are observing these phenotypes. Going back to our rather vague diabetes researcher, they tell us that they are actually investigating Type II Diabetes in geriatric populations within patient data they have access to. Now that is a lot more useful&#33;  A possible phenotype definition for what our researcher friend is doing is: &quot;Patients who are 65 or older with a diagnosis of or related to Type II Diabetes.&quot;</p>
<p>Our researcher is in much better shape on explaining what they have done.  So good that they are on their way to a research conference to present on findings from this definition&#33; Their fellow researchers, as well as some clinicians, at the conference love what they are doing and want to know how they can reproduce this definition with their own patient datasets. And, our researcher friend has documented the process... Right?</p>
<p>Definitely&#33; They have prepared it in the form of a computable phenotype definition&#33; They took the diabetes phenotype definition, looked up medical diagnosis codes, and reviewed patient data that is generally to see what could actually be computed on their patient data. Our researcher chose to implement their computable phenotype definition within a query language like SQL but having the computable phenotype definition on hand, other researchers could either adapt the SQL or re-implement it in another approach they prefer.</p>
<p>And just like that, our researcher now has a much clearer, meaningful, and impactful answer to the question, &quot;What disease are you studying?&quot;</p>
<h3 id="whats_the_process">What&#39;s the Process?</h3>
<p><img src="https://jacobzelko.com/assets/03302023175728-phenotype-workflow-diagram.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We spent a lot of time thinking through each step a researcher could potentially take on developing a phenotype definition and this diagram summarized our thinking of the entire process. Additionally, to summarize these steps, we created a checklist that could be followed here for developing a phenotype definition: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Intent</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Decide on a motivation to guide phenotype definition construction</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Literature Review</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Identify phenotypes</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Review or validate selected phenotypes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Identify Phenotypes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Specify phenotypes</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Add constraints</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Translate needs to phenotype definition</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Define disqualifiers and/or strengtheners</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Combine relevant phenotypes with a logic description</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Develop Computable Phenotype</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Review what concepts are consistently present in data</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Implement phenotype definition in a computable form</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Execute Definition</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Execute computable phenotype definition on database</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Assess &amp; Revise</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Consider assumptions within phenotype definition</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Revise phenotype definition as needed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Do, Monitor, &amp; Evaluate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Answer research question or achieve goal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&#91; &#93; Repeat phenotype definition checklist as appropriate</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about this checklist, definitely read the second part of the paper&#33; </p>
<h3 id="what_are_the_trade-offs_in_developing_a_definition">What Are the Trade-offs in Developing a Definition?</h3>
<p>The paper further goes into details about some of the trade-offs within developing a phenotype definition.  You may be surprised to hear that there would have to be trade-offs in defining a disease for a population. However, in practice, some counter-intuitive observations emerge:</p>
<p>The first is what I refer to as the paradox of phenotype definitions. A very well-intentioned but somewhat naive approach when thinking about researching specific subpopulations is to define your phenotype definition as specifically as possible. For example, a possible phenotype definition could be &quot;White male patients with depression between the ages of 40 - 49 living within rural Tennessee counties&quot;. However, with each <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//11042022134535-structural-intersectionality">intersecting feature &#40;&quot;axis&quot;&#41; imposed on a population</a>, the resulting number of patients captured is smaller and smaller. Going back to our example, if you have 1000 males in Tennessee, 100 people between the ages of 40-49, and only 50 people within rural parts of the state, then at best, you&#39;ll only end up with 50 people matching your phenotype definition. The question becomes less of how to make a precise definition and more of balancing the trade-off between if a phenotype definition actually represents the population one is investigating and how useful a phenotype definition in practice will be. </p>
<p>The second, is how a phenotype definition can differ from a computable phenotype definition. What I mean by that is a team of clinicians who may want to study a specific disease make a very clinically accurate picture of a patient population in a phenotype definition. However, when an informaticist looks at the definition and tries to implement it into a computable phenotype definition, there may be some aspects of the original phenotype definition that do not map well to a software implementation in practice. For more details, I suggest strongly to look at the first part of this paper as this topic is quite extensive.</p>
<p>Finally, and by no means exhaustive to our list of trade-offs, is the idea of, &quot;Is the data we want to analyze even computable?&quot; An excellent example that had to be cut from the paper for space reasons is the emergence of COVID19. When COVID19 emerged as a threat to humanity, everyone wanted to analyze it and understand it as rapidly as possible. However, the problem was, was that there was a long &#40;in the context of the pandemic&#41; period in which collecting data on COVID19 diagnosis and symptom-type data was not possible. Hospitals would code deaths as related to symptoms exacerbated by COVID19 &#40;myocardial infarction, pneumonia, etc.&#41;, diagnoses related to presented symptoms &#40;bronchitis, stroke, etc.&#41; but never to a formal COVID19 diagnosis. This has since been remedied by emergency measures taken by <a href="https://icd.who.int/en">ICD</a> for medical coding but now, much of the earlier pandemic data, if someone wanted to study COVID19 with any kind of phenotype definition for COVID19, is not accurate. This presents a disconnect between a known problem &#40;COVID19&#41; to be studied and what could actually be studied &#40;the data that is actually available for computation&#41;.</p>
<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h3>
<p>In summary, I sincerely believe that this paper is quite useful in many different areas&#33; Especially, this paper can now serve as a sort of touchstone for interdisciplinary teams when discussing these concepts. </p>

<h3 id="original_submission">Original Submission</h3>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>This talk explores the use of Julia in a novel observational health research study that explores health equity and mental health in ~100 million patients in an international collaborative effort across more than 4 countries. Contributions and efforts within the JuliaHealth and adjacent communities have made working with this data possible. The approaches and results shared will be valuable for potential researchers and will open new frontiers for high performance computing and health analytics.</p>
<h4 id="proposal">Proposal</h4>
<p>Conducting health research studies at scale to understand the health of specific communities and subpopulations has long been a struggle. This has been due to a variety of issues, such as a lack of international standards in the structure of electronic health records, patient claims data, and diagnoses. Moreover, the investigation of questions related to the topic of health equity &#40;that is, the skewed distribution of health resources or services to various subpopulations seeking healthcare&#41; has been largely stalled due to these problems.</p>
<p>In a previous talk I gave, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;5XsWUZX6lFM">Using Julia for Observational Health Research</a>, I presented early work on the success of using Julia within the space of observational health research in utilizing the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/02082021170353-cdm-standardized-tables/">OMOP Common Data Model</a>. In that previous work, I conducted a pilot study to characterize prevalence rates in mental health care for <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11042022141714-what-intersectionality-theory/#workable_definitions_of_intersectionality">intersectional subpopulations</a> suffering from bipolar disorder, depression, and/or suicidality. This work utilized novel tooling and approaches created within Julia to successfully analyze data from ~2.5 million Medicaid subscribers within the U.S. state of Georgia. This work earned the <a href="https://www.ohdsi.org/2022-collaborator-showcase">highest awards at the top observational health research venue</a>, drove another successful grant proposal, and resulted in <a href="https://www.nahdo.org/conference/2022/agenda">multiple invited talks</a>. Buoyed by the interest and success of this pilot work, my team and I have moved this project into the next phase: the examination of more than 100 million patients from more than 4 countries across the globe.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present advances within the JuliaHealth community and the broader Julia ecosystem that have made possible such large scale and federated analyses. In particular, novel JuliaHealth tools such as <a href="https://juliahealth.org/OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl/">OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl</a> will be highlighted to show how to analyze &quot;big&quot; <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/10282021140730-real-world-evidence/#united_states_food_and_drug_administration_definitions">real world data</a>, how using Julia can be of huge benefit within this space, and how Julia community members could start using these tools for their own research. As this study now takes place across multiple countries, time will also be spent discussing how Julia lends itself very well to robust analyses using literate programming tools such as <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a> or <a href="https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl">Weave.jl</a> and versioning processes through <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl">DrWatson.jl</a> or <a href="https://github.com/iterative/dvc">Data Version Control</a>, which can be utilized to handle each country&#39;s specific needs. Additionally, I will spend some time discussing issues encountered &#40;both technical and anthropological&#41;, ways that the Julia ecosystem could potentially grow to support future work in this research domain, and opportunities for Julia users to get involved. Finally, I will share my personal thoughts on what open questions there are to be addressed in observational health research and how Julia can be a tool to address public health questions and provide insight into questions of health disparities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this talk will highlight the real world use of Julia in large-scale health research studies built on real world data. Moreover, it will show the potential of the various ecosystems within Julia to analyze and tackle complex questions within health equity. Through this talk, I invite future Julia users and researchers to join me in pursuing the potential of Julia within the space of observational health research.</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I read this paper to find out more about the social vulnerability index and how it can be used in the state of Georgia. It wasn&#39;t particularly insightful although the discussion about calculating SVI for GA and its definition about social vulnerability was helpful.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>Social vulnerability is defined as the extent to which a community contains social characteristics that may affect the community&#39;s overall resilience &#40;18&#41;. It is affected by 	- Situational factors: Employment, Education, Income, Housing Type &#40;19, 20&#41; 	- Intrinsic factors: Age, Race, and Ethnicity &#40;19, 21&#41;</p>

<p>I never knew the term for this but historically, where African Americans were heavily enslaved is called the &quot;Black Belt&quot;. The authors found that high SVI and heat-related deaths were often found in these historical communities &#91;32&#93;.</p>

<p>This paper was probably the best paper I have read on the subject of terrorism research and how it intersects with public health and the social determinants of health. It provided a comprehensive background on what terrorism and radicalism are as well as some very useful public health terminology introducing the concept of social cohesion and social capital. Furthermore, it got at the concept of how examining terrorism and gang violence from a public health perspective is very understudied and underutilized when exploring this space.</p>
<h3 id="public_health_approach_to_terrorism">Public Health Approach to Terrorism</h3>
<p>2.6&#37; of terrorism deaths happen in the West. 72&#37; belong to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Syria</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pakistan</p>
</li>
<li><p>Iraq</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nigeria</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afghanistan - Institute for Economics and Peace. Global Terrorism Index. New York, NY. 2015.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorism associated with negative mental health outcomes in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>depression</p>
</li>
<li><p>anxiety</p>
</li>
<li><p>posttraumatic stress disorder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amongst others - Rousseau C, Jamil U, Bhui K, et al. Consequences of 9/11 and the war on terror on children’s and young adult’s mental health: a systematic review of the past 10 years. Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2015;20:173–193.</p>
<h3 id="shortcomings_of_addressing_terrorism_from_a_public_health_perspective">Shortcomings of Addressing Terrorism from a Public Health Perspective</h3>
<p>Historically public health has focused on: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preparedness strategies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Containment of terrorist fallout</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What has been missing in this space is examining:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social determinants of terrorism</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determinants for violent radicalization</p>
</li>
<li><p>Risk factors for terrorism</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="factors_leading_to_extremism">Factors Leading to Extremism</h3>
<p>A case study from the United Kingdom shows that violent radicalization is an outcome of a complex interaction among social, political, cultural, historical, and interpersonal factors.7 </p>
<p>Discrimination can be thought of as a &quot;comorbidity&quot; of social isolation and exclusionary behavior. One form of systematic discrimination is immigration policy as it directly contributes to social segregation.9 Feelings of marginalization have been shown to lead to decreased self-worth and, in turn, increase radicalization.57 Those discriminated against could then fall easily to extremist influence and ideology as a result of weakening social cohesion.52</p>
<h3 id="studying_gang_violence_as_a_proxy_for_terrorist_groups">Studying Gang Violence as a Proxy for Terrorist Groups</h3>
<p>A proxy to study terrorism is to study gang violence</p>
<p>At the individual level, gangs and terrorist organizations appeal to individuals who are psychologically deviant, have limited access to socioeconomic opportunities, or are marginalized members of society.39–44 In fact, terrorist groups attract a range of unstable individuals.45</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This seems to contradict the paper <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08232022220130-people-become-terrorists">Why Do People Become Terrorists</a> as it notes that instead, it was observed how many of these people who are not fully psychologically deviant but rather of clear mind. Furthermore, in my attempt to reconcile such different observations, I would posit that rather, both explanations and comments are valid but that &quot;unstable individuals&quot; seem to conflate a kind of negative aspect to a person whereas the linked paper avoids the notion of unstable persons and instead explains how most of these people are of clear opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goals generally exclusive to gangs:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Symbolic ends</p>
</li>
<li><p>Looser structure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Less temporary collaborations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shorter memberships</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gang occupies physical space.46</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference between gangs and terrorist groups is that gangs are often not politically motivated.47 </p>
<h3 id="positive_approaches_to_mitigate_radicalization">Positive Approaches to Mitigate Radicalization</h3>
<p>Dutch police actively sought to integrate individuals from Syria by connecting them with a psychiatrist or mentor. Then, they provided assistance to find housing or means to return to school. To round out this reintegration process, they went even further to provide &quot;whatever they needed to fully integrate back into society.&quot;67 </p>
<p>This approach, believes that to fight terrorism through policing and/or &quot;profiling&quot; will create real or perceived discrimination, humiliation, and/or marginalization. Other papers have shown <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08232022220130-people-become-terrorists">this to be an accurate assessment</a>.</p>
<p>&lt;&#33;–TODO: Add citations to note–&gt;</p>
<h3 id="problems_with_whiteness_and_terrorism_classifications">Problems with Whiteness and Terrorism Classifications</h3>
<p>Muslim Americans who come from the Middle East are often classified as &quot;White&quot; by categories set forth by the Office of Management and Budget. However, this is in complete opposition to the fact that a large proportion of Muslim Americans do not identify as &quot;White&quot;. 15 An implicit assumption and implicit problem is that people labeled &quot;White&quot; are assumed to be &quot;racially neutral.&quot;15 </p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I wanted to read this article as it was highly recommended to me by my friend, Jaan Altosaar, one of the coauthors of this piece. I was very interested in the methods they used and the approach they took to address fairness in phenotypes as although I had heard about discrepancies in phenotypes, this was a bit of a watershed paper to read in my mind exposing how phenotyping can be so skewed. Really fantastic paper and will be returning to it.</p>
<h3 id="purpose_of_paper">Purpose of Paper</h3>
<p>Biases introduced at phenotype level can risk exacerbating existing health disparities by influencing clinical guidelines and public policy is what this paper argues</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Phenotyping:</strong> Identifying a set of patients with a particular disease</p>
<p><strong>Phenotype Definitions:</strong> the process of sorting patients based on a disease they have into cohorts. This phenotyping to create definitions is done to learn more about a specific condition such as: 	- Epidemiological queries &#40;e.g., quantifying incidence of disease overtime&#41; &#40;Dubberke et al., 2012&#41; 	- Estimating and predicting risk &#40;Kaelber et al., 2012&#41;  	- Comparing effectiveness &#40;Suchard et al., 2019&#41;</p>
<p>The basis of demographic parity is the federal fourfths rule, which states that a selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than fourfths of the rate of the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact</p>
<h3 id="types_of_biases_found_in_phenotyping">Types of Biases Found in Phenotyping</h3>
<p><strong>Diagnosis Bias:</strong> a bias that prevents or causes delays to a disease diagnosis for a population due to differences in how that disease may present for that particular population. Example: 	- Heart attack literature finds that men complain of chest pain more frequently 	- Woman are likely to complain of other forms of pain. 	- Phenotype definition for heart attack with chest pain as the core symptom may not capture women &#40;Coventry et al., 2011&#41;.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment bias:</strong> a bias that prevents or causes delays to a treatment for population groups. Example: 	- VA black patients less likely to receive cardio-protective drugs than white patients &#40;Mehta et al., 2010 </p>
<p><strong>Access to Care Bias:</strong> biases that are systemic issues preventing patients from accessing healthcare options. Example: 	- Phenotype definition that requires a diagnosis to occur in outpatient settings could underrepresent patients.</p>
<h3 id="common_fairness_metrics">Common Fairness Metrics</h3>
<p><strong>Demographic Parity:</strong> difference in proportion for each protected class that receives the positive and negative outcome. Also referred to as &quot;independence&quot; or &quot;statistical parity&quot;.</p>
\[
P_0(\hat{Y}=\hat{y})=P_1(\hat{Y}=\hat{y}) \forall \hat{y} \in\{0,1\}
\]
<p><strong>Equality of Opportunity:</strong> when true positive rates of a model are equal across demographics</p>
\[
P_0(\hat{Y}=1 \mid Y=1)=P_1(\hat{Y}=1 \mid Y=1)
\]
<p><strong>Predictive Rate Parity:</strong> when probability of true labels given the predicted label is the same across classes</p>
\[
P_0(Y=1 \mid \hat{Y}=1)=P_1(Y=1 \mid \hat{Y}=1)
\]
<p>and </p>
\[
P_0(Y=0 \mid \hat{Y}=0)=P_1(Y=0 \mid \hat{Y}=0)
\]

<h3 id="operational_definitions">Operational Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Phenotype:</strong> a measurable biological, behavioral, or cognitive marker found more often in specific individuals than the general population; the appearance it presents to observers.&#91;1&#93;</p>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/./08122022205622-assessing-phenotype-fairness"><strong>Phenotyping:</strong></a> Identifying a set of patients with a particular disease </p>
<p><strong>Computable phenotype:</strong> a clinical element that can derived from queries to an EHR or ancillary data sources &#40;such as claims data, or disease registries&#41; using a defined set of data elements and logical expressions.  It does not require chart review or interpretation by a clinician. </p>
<p><strong>Data element:</strong> the unit of data being queried, exchanged, or analyzed. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Descriptive name for the concept</p>
</li>
<li><p>A specified value set</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional metadata</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Value set:</strong> the set of possible information associated with a particular data element. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong> descriptive data about objects, including data objects; data about data.</p>
<h3 id="computable_phenotypes_definitions">Computable Phenotypes Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Computable phenotype definitions:</strong> classifying individuals with a given characteristic of interest from EHRs. Done by using data routinely collected in EHRs or ancillary data sources &#40;such as claims data, or disease registries&#41;.</p>
<p>Computable phenotype definitions enable reproducible queries of EHRs. They are made of data elements and boolean operators which are executed by a computer. Furthermore, they rely on value sets derived from standardized coding systems.</p>
<p>These definitions help identify people with particular conditions across healthcare organizations by using common definitions. Standard phenotype definitions can enable direct identification of cohorts. This allows decision-makers to specifically target screening tests and interventions to such cohorts.</p>

<p>Poverty of material conditions alone does not explain a biological explanation for causes of impaired lifespans.</p>
<p>It is historically noted that there is a general shortage of randomized control trials to determine the utility of interventions in all areas of public health. DIscussion about the lack of controlled trials in public health pertaining to the social determinants area and the field of public health in general.</p>
<p>James Lind is rightly acknowledged as an exceptional public health figure because as early as the 18th century he conducted controlled investigations to show citrus fruit cured scurvy. By contrast, John Snow’s determination in the 19th century that ingestion of contaminated water led to cholera, relied on careful observation and the exercise of reasoned judgement rather than his uncontrolled experiment of removing the handle of the Broad Street pump.</p>
<p>When approaching the area of social determinants, risk factors were first separated from behaviours and biological markers.</p>
<p>Causes of the causes can be thought of as the underlying issues that give rise or is directly related to a given issue. </p>
<p>Second method of approach by Marmot to examine the social determinants of health. To give an example: &quot;It is not an accident that people consume diets high in saturated fat and salt. It represents the nature of the food supply, culture, affordability, and availability, among other influences.&quot;</p>
<p>The psychosocial understanding of the social determinants of health emphasizes experiential personal accounts. Negative accounts which induce acute and chronic stress affect human biology. This ultimately leads to impairment of physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The social gradient of health goes from the high echelons of society to those living in dire conditions. Each step down this hierarchy also lowers standards of health.</p>
<h3 id="the_fallacy_of_diseases_of_the_rich_and_poor">The Fallacy of Diseases of the Rich and Poor</h3>
<p>There existed the notion that there were diseases of the rich and of the poor. Mortality rate reflected this belief. However, this was false.</p>
<p>The impoverished are not the only ones to anguish. An example being that despite civil servants being economically well-off, it was found there was an inverse relationship between employment grade and risk for causes of death.</p>
<p>Stress does not only affect senior managers or others in positions of great public responsibility. High effort linked to high reward is generally health promoting. &#91;1&#93; Poor health is seen where there is limited, real or perceived, control over a situation with a small chance of reward where the situation is psychologically demanding during an extended period of time. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that infectionand immunity may also be important in two poorly recognized ways </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A contributory cause of diseases not previously considered to be due to infection</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chronic stress may alter susceptibility to infection and its severity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the_fight_or_flight_response_and_its_role_in_disease">The Fight Or Flight Response and Its Role in Disease</h3>
<p>The fight or flight response is brief and rather unusual for animals. The response can be vital for an animal&#39;s survival. For humans, emergencies are comparatively rare. However, for people, regular psychological demands and challenges may activate the fight or flight response too often. </p>
<p>Fight-or-flight adapts well to acute stress but may not to chronic stress in today’s urban environment. &#91;4&#93;</p>
<p>Prolonged elevated cortisol amounts can manifest paranoia or depression.</p>
<h4 id="sympatho-adrenal_pathway">Sympatho-Adrenal Pathway</h4>
<p><img src="07132020192025-heart-adrenaline.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Heart rate is directly impacted by sympathetic nerve impulses. It is indirectly affected by circulating adrenaline level.</p>
<p>Increased &quot;stickiness&quot; in platelets occurs due to increases in adrenaline in the blood. Blood tends to become more concentrated and viscous at the same time. Stress-related hormones can increase the output of fibrinogen from the liver. This may add to formation of arterial plaques and increased risks of heart disease and stroke &#91;5&#93;, &#91;6&#93;</p>
<p>The sympatho-adrenal pathway activates, prepares for, or maintains physical exertion. It causes psychological arousal and energy mobilization. It inhibits functions irrelevant to immediatesurvival. Degree of activation depends on stressorand its duration. Thesympatho-adrenal pathway can be switched off rapidly.</p>
<p>The first pathway is the sympatho-adrenal pathway and activates quickly. It consists of the sympathetic branch of the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12302020174059-autonomic-nervous-system">autonomic nervous system</a>. The pathway produces two hormones:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Noradrenaline at nerve endings</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adrenaline directly into the bloodstream by the medulla &#40;or middle part&#41; of the adrenal glands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This produces the sensation of our stomach tightening when being exposed to sudden shock.</p>
<h4 id="hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal_hpa_axis">Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; Axis</h4>
<p><img src="07132020192442-hpa-axis.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure from Chapter 2 of &#91;7&#93;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; Axis operates over minutes and hours. Its key components are the three corresponding hormone secreting glands. The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; axis is the slower, seconday response to stress. It results in cortisol release into the bloodstream from adrenal glands. The dotted lines show feedback controls which regulate release of cortisol and other corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex.</p>
<h4 id="effects">Effects</h4>
<p>Circulating adrenaline and sympathetic nerve activity generated during the Fight or Flight response:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Accelerate heart rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase metabolic rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase blood pressure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase sensory vigilance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase sweat secretion</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate pupils</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate airways</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate blood vessels in skeletal muscles</p>
</li>
<li><p>Constrict blood vessels in skin and gut</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inhibit salivation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Glucocorticoid hormones, like cortisol, have metabolic and psychological effects. These hormones are vital to upkeep and regulation of resting and stress-related metabolic functions. </p>
<p>In emergency situations, glucocorticoid hormones are antagonistic to the insulin hormone, resulting in the mobilization of energy reserves via elevation of blood glucose and fatty acid release from fat tissues. This is very desirable in emergencies. </p>
<p>However, in non-emergencies, unneeded energy that can be released tends to increase output into the blood of cholesterol-carrying particles from the liver.</p>
<h4 id="overall_response_to_stress">Overall Response to Stress</h4>
<p><img src="07132020191448-stress-baselines.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Shown are idealized representations of neuroendocrine and metabolic activity in the presence of stress. &#40; a &#41; depicts rapid baseline recovery as responsive and flexible &#40; b &#41; illustrates a slow recovery but an eventual delayed return to baseline &#40; c &#41; shows a weak reaction with an elevated baseline alongside a small response.</p>
<p>If a stress response is activated too regularly, feedback controls within the neuroendocrine system could reset one&#39;s baseline to a new elevated and potentially health-damaging level driven by environmental factors &#91;8&#93;, &#91;9&#93;</p>

<p>How the brain, HPA axis, and immunesystem communicate with one another. The brain perceives cognitive stimuli. This perception can influence immune function via neuropeptides, the ANS, and the HPA axis. The immune system responds to non-cognitive stimuli. Examples of non-cognitive stimuli are infection and tumour growth. Cytokines and peptidehormones are secreted which affect the brain and neuroendocrine system. <em>RQ: ASD dysregulation of cytokines are directly impacted by the interference COVID19 thus further complicating response in the HPA axis.</em></p>
<h4 id="social_effects_on_well-being">Social Effects on Well-Being</h4>
<p><img src="07132020184157-well-being-impacts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Further, the balance of influences on health depends on geographical location and historical circumstances of the population in question.</p>
<p>This generalized diagram includes circumstances beyond individual control as well as personal situations. From the top left to the bottom right, there is a clear chain of influence between social structure and well-being.</p>
<p>Given the correct information, a similar pictogram could be made for each category of disease.</p>
<p>Current thoughts about everything which can impact overall well-being.</p>
<p>The social and cultural environment and organization of work are current factors in consideration in public policy. Psychological and biological factors are latent causes of disease. These tend to be the main focus of medical attention. In reality, these factors are intermediates on the pathway from social position to an individual&#39;s state of health. &#91;10&#93;</p>
<p>Social structure affects an individual via three primary influences:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Material circumstances are related to health directly through one&#39;s social and work environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Material circumstances then impacts psychological factors and health-related behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Early life experiences, cultural, and genetic factors also exert influences on health.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One example is a study of children at orphanages:</p>
<p>Under the same food conditions, children in the ‘Bienenhaus&#39; orphanage under the control of a stern Fraülein Schwarz, gained less weight and grew slowly. This opposite to children under the care of the affectionate Fraülein Grün at the ‘Vogelnest&#39; orphanage.  Schwarz replaced Grün during the study at ‘Vogelnest&#39; and growth rates were subsequently reversed. This controlled cross-over study provides evidence that adverse psychosocial circumstances in childhood can influence growth. &#91;11&#93;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be careful about conflating correlation with causation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been closely examining the Hypothalamus Pituitary &#40;HPA&#41; axis and have seen how cytokines directly interact with it. &#91;1&#93; Therefore, since ASD has been correlated with cytokine dysregulation &#91;2&#93;, it can be reasonable to suspect that as coronavirae can also impact cytokine regulation &#91;3&#93;, ASD is a risk factor for COVID19 causing direct problems with the HPA axis leading to multiple downstream issues.</p>
<p>ASD has been correlated with abnormal immune function. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Cytokine dysregulation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inflammation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Presence of autoantibodies</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Studies show the presence of anti-brain immunoglobulins in ASD patients. &#91;4&#93; ASD status could also be directly correlated with patients’ cytokine and chemokine levels which cause organ inflammation &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>There is a second phase resulting in a cytokine storm which particularly affects respiratory epithelium &#91;5&#93;. The storm activates cytokines IL-1-beta, IL-6 and TNFalfa. These activations aggravate respiratory symptoms. These cytokines cause damage to pulmonary microvasculature. It simultaneously affects apoptosis and chemotaxis resulting in decreases of epithelial barriers and alveolar edema <em>Back up references about cytokines</em></p>

<p>The consideration of only monotonic effects were accounted. Relationships between digital media use and health are generally non-monotonic. Associations often follow a J-shaped curve. The first issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. This is nicknamed the Goldilocks hypothesis which was posited by Przybylski himself. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; A. K. Przybylski and N. Weinstein, &quot;A large-scale test of the goldilocks hypothesis: quantifying the relations between digital-screen use and the mental well-being of adolescents,&quot; Psychological Science, vol. 28, no. 2, pp. 204–215, 2017.</p>
<p>The global adolescent mental health crisis started around 2012 and greatly affects girls more so than boys &#91;5&#93;. As TV is now commonplace and TV watching amongst adolescents has declined after 2012 &#91;6&#93;, TV watching does not suggest an adequate explanation for the sudden increase in mental health disorders. The second issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;5&#93; S. McManus et al., &quot;Prevalence of non-suicidal self-harm and service contact in England, 2000–14: repeated cross-sectional surveys of the general population,&quot; The lancet psychiatry, vol. 6, no. 7, pp. 573–581, 2019. &#91;6&#93; J. M. Twenge, G. N. Martin, and B. H. Spitzberg, &quot;Trends in US Adolescents’ media use, 1976–2016: The rise of digital media, the decline of TV, and the &#40;near&#41; demise of print.,&quot; Psychology of Popular Media Culture, vol. 8, no. 4, p. 329, 2019.</p>
<p>The Monitoring the Future dataset examines digital media usage via two ways. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A minimal variance scale with labels that range from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;almost every day.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>A sufficiently varied count of weekly hours spent on digital media.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, Orben and Przybylski only included low-variance items. The fourth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; J. E. Schulenberg, L. D. Johnston, P. M. O’Malley, J. G. Bachman, R. A. Miech, and M. E. Patrick, &quot;Monitoring the Future national survey results on drug use, 1975-2016: Volume II, College students and adults ages 19-55,&quot; 2017.</p>
<p>Including controls that could in fact be mediators. The fifth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. Orben and Przybylski control for factors such as negative attitudes towards school, time spent with parents, parent distress and closeness to parents, which could be caused by heavy social media use. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4.</p>
<p>Using \(r^{2}\) for effect size has multiple problems. The sixth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; C. J. Ferguson, &quot;An effect size primer: a guide for clinicians and researchers.,&quot; 2016. &#91;2&#93; D. C. Funder and D. J. Ozer, &quot;Evaluating effect size in psychological research: Sense and nonsense,&quot; Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 156–168, 2019.</p>
<p>Heavy use of social media is regularly correlated with negative mental health outcomes of varying severity. This relationship disproportionately affects girls. Given that there is no plausible alternative explanation for this association, associations with a variety of adverse mental health conditions in girls should not be dismissed. Adverse events being rising rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; S. McManus et al., &quot;Prevalence of non-suicidal self-harm and service contact in England, 2000–14: repeated cross-sectional surveys of the general population,&quot; The lancet psychiatry, vol. 6, no. 7, pp. 573–581, &#91;1&#93; &#91;2&#93; J. M. Twenge, &quot;Why increases in adolescent depression may be linked to the technological environment,&quot; Current opinion in psychology, vol. 32, pp. 89–94, 2020.2019.</p>
<p>Effect sizes include many individual items. These are lower in internal reliability than multiple-item scales and thus produce lower effect sizes. Scales with more items count more heavily in the analysis because they have more items. &#91;1&#93; L. J. Cronbach and P. E. Meehl, &quot;Construct validity in psychological tests.,&quot; Psychological bulletin, vol. 52, no. 4, p. 281, 1955. The third issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski</p>
<p>Mediators are a possible reason behind an effect. They should not be controlled. This is from an email conversation with Jean Twenge about this issue. For example, it is plausible that excessive social media use causes teens to spend less time with their parents. Thus this variable should not be a covariate, as it might partially explain why the correlation between social media use and depression occurs in the first place. </p>

<p>In this particular study, a cohort of 971 individuals were involved in smoking cessation sessions hosted at smoking cessation clinics between 1986 and 1990. The intervention developed at these sessions for a participant involved attending eight 90 minute group sessions over a period of 4 months. The biggest of the groups reached 110 attendees. 3 months after a group quit date, 39.3&#37; of cohort self-reported as non-smoking. Thereafter, 32.1&#37; and 26.0&#37; of the cohort at 6 and 12 months respectively reported non-smoking. Finally, at an 8 year check-in, 33.9&#37; of the cohort were reached. 47.7&#37; reported not currently smoking &#40;16.2 of total cohort&#41;. &#91;pg. 725&#93;</p>
<p>33.9&#37; and 66.1&#37; of the cohort were male and female respectively. Participants averaged an age of 39.9. &#91;pg. 729&#93; Interestingly, it was found that the motivation for the cohort came from oneself with 81.2&#37; saying they wanted to quit. 3.4&#37; said they were motivated by others and 14.5&#37; said they were motivated by themselves and others. &#91;pg. 730&#93; The participants who were not successful in quitting smoking for 3 months reported not being prepared to quit. &#91;pg. 737&#93; The success rates that were reported were reasonably not significantly biased to positive or negative outcomes due to a loose balance between those who started with both <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05182020005014-smoking-recovery-indicators">great and poor quitting conditions</a> &#40;linked to related quitting factors&#41;. &#91;pg. 732&#93; Race was not accounted for in this study.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>Each session included topics such as education about the negative consequences of smoking, how to self monitor, and strategies for modifying behavior to disassociate smoking from pleasure. &quot;Butt jars&quot; were used to create aversive sensations to smoking via association with pictures of cancerous organs. In contrast, non-smoking behavior was rewarded in the idea of a &quot;money jar&quot;. The money jar contains the money a participant would have used for smoking and is instead set aside to be used to finance enjoyable activity. &#91;pg. 728&#93;</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The part of the study program most helpful to participants was the supportive nature of the large group setting. Despite large group sizes, individuals thought they were supported very well. The support and the accepting, non-judgemental atmosphere provided in groups promoted cessation. This study illustrated that a Cognitive Behavioral grounding in smoking cessation can produce success with large group participant. &#91;pg. 738&#93;</p>

<p>Electrodermal activity &#40;EDA&#41; broadly refers to any electrical activity across the dermis of the skin &#40;the dermis being the outermost layer of the skin&#41;. Whenever the body experiences stress – this could be in the form of an ambient temperature change, physical activity, etc. – the sympathetic nervous system &#40;SNS&#41; increases sudomotor innervation, which leads to increases in EDA and sweating. The SNS is directly influenced by parts of the brain responsible for emotional response – the hypothalamus and limbic system. Because of this codependency, EDA is commonly used to study stress and other affective behavior &#40;mood, disorders, etc.&#41;.</p>
<p>EDA has been used to study the following sort of conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Arousal in Emotion &#91;1&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attention &#91;2&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decision-making &#91;3&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pain &#91;4&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stress &#91;5&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Autism &#91;6&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Phobias &#91;7&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Panic Disorder &#91;8&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attention Deficit Disorders &#91;9&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Side Effects from Cancer Treatments &#91;10&#93;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The use cases of EDA is further explored by <em>Boucsein et. al.</em> in their book, <em>Electrodermal Activity</em>. &#91;11&#93;</p>
<p>Furthermore, EDA is a generalization of the overall signal – in reality, this signal is often decomposed into <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04092020162632-skin-response">Skin Conductance Response &#40;SCR&#41;</a> and <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04092020161622-skin-conductance">Skin Conductance Level &#40;SCL&#41;</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what_is_sars-cov-2">What is SARS-CoV-2?</h3>
<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a <a href="03102020054429-coronavirus-definition">betacoronavirus</a>, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.</p>
<p>Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Currently, the World Health Organization has not classified this situation as a pandemic though this stance is highly contentious. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>UPDATE &#40;MARCH 11th&#41;:_ As of now, this situation is now classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Here is an image showing its transmission across the world:</p>
<p><img src="03102020050115-covid19-jhu-arcgis.jpg" alt="arcgis-sars" /></p>
<h4 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h4>
<p>The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure &#40;this is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses &#91;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus&#93;&#41; &#91;4&#93;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cough</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shortness of breath</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>1 - 2&#37; is the current estimate though it could get higher. &#91;5&#93;</p>
<h4 id="a_href03102020053006-cdc-respiratory-preventionsprevention_methods"><a href="03102020053006-cdc-respiratory-preventions"><strong>Prevention Methods:</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay home when you are sick.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60&#37; alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</p>

<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus &#40;named SARS-CoV-2&#41;.</p>

<p>Several estimates have suggested that the risk of dying, for those infected with covid-19 and showing its flu-like symptoms, is around 1 or 2 percent. Elderly adults have a considerably higher risk of both becoming infected and dying, as do people with compromised immune systems. The estimates might change as new data arrive, but the range of 1 to 2 percent for fatalities among the symptomatic seems to be the consensus for now. The overall fatality rate for people infected with covid-19 will be lower &quot;possibly much lower&quot; when we know how many people are infected but asymptomatic.</p>
