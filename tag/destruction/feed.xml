<p>&quot;Sometimes the job of a data scientist is to know when you don&#39;t know enough.&quot;</p>

<h3 id="general_observations">General Observations</h3>
<p>According to O&#39;neil, profits have often come about to provide a stand-in as a value judgement on what is right or true. To that end, we are often vetted by algorithmically based on who we are &#40;e.g. our backgrounds, race, etc.&#41; and not on how we actually perform or fare.</p>
<p>Model construction happens from:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>not just from data but from the choices we make about which data to pay attention to—and which to leave out.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those choices are not just about logistics, profits, and efficiency. They are fundamentally moral. We have to learn to interrogate our data collection process, not just our algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="credit_scores_as_a_proxy_for_human_value">Credit Scores as a Proxy for Human Value</h3>
<p>When considering credit scores, money or wealth is no longer just about a means of survival. Wrapped up in these scores is also a value judgement on someone&#39;s self-worth. </p>
<p>Algorithms prioritize two factors: efficiency and profit. They do not care about justice or the well-being of the people underlying the data they are analyzing.</p>
<h3 id="concluding_thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h3>
<p>So the first step is to get a grip on our techno-utopia, that unbounded and unwarranted hope in what algorithms and technology can accomplish. Before asking them to do better, we have to admit they can’t do everything</p>
<p>audits have to be carefully designed and tested by human beings, and afterward automated</p>
