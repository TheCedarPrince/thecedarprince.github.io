<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>In reading a piece by Michael Nielsen on using spaced repetition to process mathematics &#91;1&#93;, he referenced a concept called &quot;chunking&quot;. I hadn&#39;t encountered this notion in education research before and thought it sounded interesting.  So, thus reading the paper.</p>
<h3 id="what_are_chunks">What Are Chunks?</h3>
<p>Loosely based on &#91;2&#93;, chunks are constructs which organize and group together units of information input into memory. These inputs can be of any form and the basic units could be things like phonemes in words, moves in chess, etc. that can then be recalled at once &#40;a Bible verse, a Sicilian Defense, etc.&#41;. The material stored in a chunk is independent of how many chunks can be generated.</p>
<h3 id="benefits_of_chunk_generation">Benefits of Chunk Generation</h3>
<p>The memory span seems to be constrained by a fixed number of chunks &#40;although this number varies wildly in the paper&#41;.  However, we can increase the information stored in memory by increasing the number of units belonging to each chunk. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>As regaled by Simon, an example of chunking in action is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried to recall after one reading the following list of words: Lincoln, milky, criminal, differential, address, way, lawyer, calculus, Gettysburg. I had no success whatsoever. I should not have expected success, for the list exceeded my span of six or seven words. Then I rearranged the list a bit, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg Address</p>
</li>
<li><p>Milky Way</p>
</li>
<li><p>Criminal Lawyer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Differential Calculus</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I had no difficulty at all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The variance between chunks and memory can be attributed to larger chunk sizes based on one&#39;s expertise with a material. &#91;4&#93;</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A note that provides an overview to intensive care unit scoring systems</p>

<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>A. Rapsang and D. C. Shyam, &quot;Scoring systems in the intensive care unit: A compendium,&quot; Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine, vol. 18, no. 4, pp. 220–228, Apr. 2014, doi: 10.4103/0972-5229.130573.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>What is a Scoring System?</li><li>What Characterizes a Scoring System?</li><li>What Are Characteristics of an Ideal Model?</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>This paper was useful as it provided a good overview of intensive care unit scoring systems. It enumerated their characteristics and also talked about their advantages. The paper also went over a variety of scoring systems but as I was concerned with learning what scoring systems in general were, I stopped there.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_a_scoring_system">What is a Scoring System?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is one approach clinical staff in an intensive care unit utilize to predict patient outcomes <em>and</em> to improve clinical decisions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, intensive care unit scoring systems&#33;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is an intensive care unit scoring system?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These scoring systems &#40;also referred to as severity scales&#41; are calculated alongside traditional diagnosis methods. They are used to: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Predict patient outcomes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compare quality of care</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create breakdowns for clinical trials</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They are handy for also analyzing unexpected patient outcomes and what precipitated the outcome.</p>
<h3 id="what_characterizes_a_scoring_system">What Characterizes a Scoring System?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a scoring system comprised of?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A scoring system generally has two components:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Score - a number assigned to a given disease based on severity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Probability Model - determines the probability of patient deaths.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>How are scoring system probability models used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, a model gives clinical decision makers additional insight into comparing patient populations for:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Treatment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Triage</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comparative analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Understanding treatment effectiveness</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimizing resources</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what_are_characteristics_of_an_ideal_model">What Are Characteristics of an Ideal Model?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the three characteristics of an ideal model for scoring?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ideal model must be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Valid</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calibrated</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discriminated</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean for a model to have &quot;validity&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Validity&quot; means how well a model performs on test datasets during the model&#39;s creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does a &quot;calibrated&quot; model mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accuracy between estimated mortality probabilities and the actual mortalities experienced by patients. What is key to note is that it is also able to be statistically robust/rigorous. &#91;1&#93; Essentially, is the model well suited to the actual patients being evaluated?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does a model that is &quot;discriminatory&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How well the model can determine what patients live and what patients die in practice. Examples of measures used to understand discriminatory patterns in a model are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sensitivity</p>
</li>
<li><p>Specificity</p>
</li>
<li><p>False positive rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>False negative rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Positive predictive power</p>
</li>
<li><p>Misclassification rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concordance. &#91;2&#93;</p>
</li>
</ul>
