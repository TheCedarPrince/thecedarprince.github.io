<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I sometimes find myself wanting to execute a Julia file I have just edited.  This is different than what the excellent <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl">Revise.jl package &#40;created by Tim Holy&#41;</a> does in that I want to execute the full file and not just update function definitions. Moreover, I may just want Julia to do something else entirely upon updating a file or directory. This can be very helpful in analysis workflows as well as literate programming. Creating an extended post on my process for this was inspired by a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://discourse.julialang.org/t/franklin-jl-automatically-evaluate-jl-file-on-change/92580/6">Julia Discourse post I provided an answer to</a>.</p>
<h3 id="set-up">Set-Up</h3>
<p>Here is how I recommend setting up your Julia environment to follow this tutorial &#40;I assume you have Julia installed correctly&#41;:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create an empty directory &#40;folder&#41; somewhere on your computer. &#40;NOTE: For sake of this tutorial, I will refer to it as the &quot;test&quot; folder&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Within your favorite text editor &#40;like Notepad, Vim, VSCode, etc.&#41;, open this directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open and create a file called &quot;tmp.jmd&quot; &#40;NOTE: Keep the file and your editor open as we will be coming back to this file quite a lot&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open your Julia REPL within the directory and activate a temporary environment within package mode:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">pkg&gt; activate --temp</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Add into this temporary environment the following packages:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">pkg&gt; add FileWatching, Weave</code></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li><p>Install node onto your machine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I suggest using the great tool, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"><code>nvm</code>, which allows easy management of node versions</a>.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><p>Install the node package, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync"><code>browser-sync</code>, which allows for syncing of webpages based on updates</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the command you can use in your command line: </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm i -g browser-sync</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Steps 6 and 7 are not necessary if you are not interested in the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/#asynchronous-workflow-for-literate-programming">section on literate programming</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="simple_workflow_process">Simple Workflow Process</h3>
<p>There are two ways to start this workflow.  One blocking &#40;i.e. you cannot use the Julia REPL while working&#41; and another spawning an asynchronous background process to enable you to work with the same REPL. Here is gif showing these workflows in action:</p>
<p><img src="assets/01082023043553-watching-example.gif" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="blocking_workflow">Blocking Workflow</h4>
<p>This creates a synchronous task in your Julia REPL that can then run whatever command you want while you monitor a specific file &#40;or folder&#41;. In this case, I am making the task print a statement that says “Change Detected&#33;” to my REPL whenever there is a change in the file called “tmp.jmd”.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">using FileWatchingwhile true 
    watch_file&#40;&quot;./tmp.jmd&quot;&#41;
    println&#40;&quot;Change Detected&#33;&quot;&#41;
end</code></pre>
<p>This workflow is not optimal as this loop continues and locks your REPL from doing anything else. </p>
<h4 id="asynchronous_workflow">Asynchronous Workflow</h4>
<p>This creates an asynchronous task in the background of your Julia REPL that can then run whatever command you want while you monitor a specific file &#40;or folder&#41;. In this case, I am making the task print a statement that says “Change Detected&#33;” to my REPL whenever there is a change in the file called “tmp.jmd”.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">using FileWatching@async while true 
    watch_file&#40;&quot;./tmp.jmd&quot;&#41;
    println&#40;&quot;Change Detected&#33;&quot;&#41;
end</code></pre>
<p>From here, you could then still interact with this REPL while this task is running in the background. Furthermore, you can change the line that says <code>println&#40;&quot;Change Detected&#33;&quot;&#41;</code> to whatever command &#40;or commands&#41; you want to trigger.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous_workflow_for_literate_programming">Asynchronous Workflow for Literate Programming</h3>
<p>This workflow allows one to work with a Julia Markdown document with <code>Weave.jl</code> to preview your work in real time.  There a few steps to start the workflow but here is how it looks when in operation:</p>
<p><img src="assets/01082023043553-weave-example.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>First, execute the following snippet in your Julia REPL to start the asynchronous process to watch for changes and tell Julia to weave the file we will modify:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">using FileWatching
using Weave@async while true 
    watch_file&#40;&quot;./tmp.jmd&quot;&#41;
    weave&#40;&quot;./tmp.jmd&quot;&#41;
end</code></pre>
<p>Next, run this in a separate terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">browser-sync start --server --start --file &quot;./*.html&quot;</code></pre>
<p>or this command within your Julia REPL &#40;NOTE: This will make your REPL session very cluttered but you can still use your REPL&#41;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">@async run&#40;&#96;browser-sync start --server --start --file &quot;./*.html&quot;&#96;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you should see <code>browser-sync</code> spit out a lot of information that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">&#91;Browsersync&#93; Access URLs:
 --------------------------------------
       Local: http://localhost:3000
    External: http://192.168.1.186:3000
 --------------------------------------
          UI: http://localhost:3001
 UI External: http://localhost:3001
 --------------------------------------
&#91;Browsersync&#93; Serving files from: ./</code></pre>
<p>You&#39;ll want to grab that URL that looks like <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in the <code>Local</code> spot and then open that in your web browser.  With the URL that you get &#40;it could be on a different port&#41;, navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/tmp.html</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, when you have this all in place, go ahead and add this code block into the <code>tmp.jmd</code> file that was created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Hello World This is a Julia Markdown file. &#96;&#96;&#96;julia 
2 &#43; 2
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code></pre>
<p>You should see a few things happen.  You&#39;ll see a few messages from the Julia REPL stating that <code>Weave.jl</code> is weaving your document to your desired output. Then, you&#39;ll see <code>browser-sync</code> say something about updating or syncing.  Finally, you will see your browser update to the latest version of your weaved document. </p>
<p>Feel free to play around with this more and see the dynamism of the workflow&#33; I tend to do this when I am iteratively developing reports within Julia and want to tinker within the REPL at the same time I am creating documents. Having to wait for rendering <code>Weave.jl</code> documents and the like was a pain and this took the pain away.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope you appreciated this post&#33; If you have any suggestions, comments, or additional workflows this could be used for, please comment below.  May your Julia sessions now be even more supercharged&#33;</p>

<p>H. A. Simon, &quot;How Big Is a Chunk? By combining data from several experiments, a basic human memory unit can be identified and measured.,&quot; Science, vol. 183, no. 4124, pp. 482–488, 1974.</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>In reading a piece by Michael Nielsen on using spaced repetition to process mathematics &#91;1&#93;, he referenced a concept called &quot;chunking&quot;. I hadn&#39;t encountered this notion in education research before and thought it sounded interesting.  So, thus reading the paper.</p>
<h3 id="what_are_chunks">What Are Chunks?</h3>
<p>Loosely based on &#91;2&#93;, chunks are constructs which organize and group together units of information input into memory. These inputs can be of any form and the basic units could be things like phonemes in words, moves in chess, etc. that can then be recalled at once &#40;a Bible verse, a Sicilian Defense, etc.&#41;. The material stored in a chunk is independent of how many chunks can be generated.</p>
<h3 id="benefits_of_chunk_generation">Benefits of Chunk Generation</h3>
<p>The memory span seems to be constrained by a fixed number of chunks &#40;although this number varies wildly in the paper&#41;.  However, we can increase the information stored in memory by increasing the number of units belonging to each chunk. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>As regaled by Simon, an example of chunking in action is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried to recall after one reading the following list of words: Lincoln, milky, criminal, differential, address, way, lawyer, calculus, Gettysburg. I had no success whatsoever. I should not have expected success, for the list exceeded my span of six or seven words. Then I rearranged the list a bit, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg Address</p>
</li>
<li><p>Milky Way</p>
</li>
<li><p>Criminal Lawyer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Differential Calculus</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I had no difficulty at all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The variance between chunks and memory can be attributed to larger chunk sizes based on one&#39;s expertise with a material. &#91;4&#93;</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I have always found graph theory interesting ever since I was exposed to it back in my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech. I found out about it through SIR Modeling but personally found the structure of graphs far more fascinating than its application to SIR models. Furthermore, as I intend to be pursuing graduate studies in applied mathematics, why not get started with trying to understand it?</p>

<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com//05222022225241-understanding-media-extensions.md">I was motivated to write this thought while writing my review on Marshall MacLuhan&#39;s masterpiece, <em>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</em>, while ruminating on his idea that I refer to as the &quot;action and reaction&quot;.</a> <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//12242022211924-simultaneity-relativity.md">It feels as though there exists an analogy between Einstein&#39;s notion of relativity of simultaneity and MacLuhan&#39;s idea concept of &quot;action and reaction&quot; – this note attempts to explain that analogous relationship.</a></p>

<p><strong>Context-aware applications</strong> are technologies that leverage data collected from real-time environments and contexts and act upon this information to create timely actions. This idea was coined by &#91;1&#93; in his paper <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020035135-kidd-aware-home">The Aware Home: A Living Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing Research</a></p>
<p>Here is the original quote from @kiddAwareHomeLiving1999:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>However, progress in the sensing technologies needs to be matched by progress in supporting the rapid development of applications that use sensed information. These applications are what &#91;are&#93; called <strong>context-aware applications</strong>.</em></p>

<h3 id="what_is_an_aware_home">What Is an Aware Home?</h3>
<p>In short, an Aware Home is &quot;a living laboratory for research in ubiquitous computing for everyday activities.&quot; The home at Georgia Institute of Technology was built to enable researchers ready access to explore the home and implement technologies to monitor individuals going throughout the home – these same technologies, the hope is, would be implement in actual people&#39;s homes across the world.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Some of the ideas for potential use from the home was to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support the elderly</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find lost objects</p>
</li>
<li><p>Monitor specific parts of the house &#40;front door, kitchen, etc.&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This would be using a technology known as <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020071146-context-aware"><em>Context-Aware Applications</em></a> &#40;click for more information&#41;.</p>

<p>I have been trying to understand what health actually is.  After much thinking, I have come to the conclusion that health can be thought of as a spectrum.  This is similar to the idea that <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020022908-education-spectrum">education is a spectrum</a>.</p>

<p>I was suggested this paper by Sarah Gasman of Boston Medical Center. She suggested it as has it holds great relevance to some of my research on health disparities. I must say, this paper was revelatory and plan a future discussion with the study authors due to how incredible it was to my mind.</p>

<h3 id="why_are_intersectional_approaches_needed">Why Are Intersectional Approaches Needed?</h3>
<p>Prior literature has shown multiple examples where an understanding of intersectionality is useful in a health context: 	- Racism, sexism, and classism are interlocking, mutually constituted, and reinforcing &#40;Collins 2000; Crenshaw 1991; Dill and Zambrana 2009&#41; 	- Effects of racial, gender, and socioeconomic stratification are nonadditive &#40;meaning that racial, gender, and socioeconomic aspects do not all equally contribute to problems in intersectionality &#91;e.g. gender could have more impact than race considerations in certain situations&#93;&#41;. 	It was observed that the greatest racial inequalities in health were found among women and furthermore seen among those women with higher levels of socioeconomic status &#40;Brown et al. 2016; Cummings and Jackson 2008; Warner and Brown 2011&#41;.</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>As I have learned and understood what <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//10152022173643-image-of-sets.md">images</a> are, I am now on my quest to learn what preimages so that I can understand the concept of bundles&#33;</p>
<h3 id="basics_on_the_preimage_of_a_subset">Basics on the Preimage of a Subset</h3>
<p>Given some function \(f : A \rightarrow B\) and the subsets \(C \subseteq A\) and \(D \subseteq B\), then the preimage &#40;or inverse image of a set&#41; is:</p>
\[
f^{-1}(D) = \{x \in A : f(x) \in D\}
\]
<p>Which has the interesting property that the image of each element in \(D\) is in \(C\).</p>
<p>For some reason, admittedly, this was more challenging for me to understand than the image of a subset.  Why that is, I do not know; maybe my brain has a bit of a challenge thinking in reverse?  Personally, I find imagining the notation of the definition more easily followed when it is written like this: </p>
\[
f^{-1}(D) = \{x \in A : f(x) = D\}
\]
<p>Notice the subtle notation change I introduced where I said \(=\) instead of \(\in\) which, although interchangeable here, reads more clearly in my mind. Essentially, you say the condition for this set to be any element, \(x\), that satisfies the equation, \(f(x) = D\). To me, my brain translates that condition into a fun challenge rather than an abstract \(\in D\) which reads less concretely.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>Let \(X = \mathbb R\), \(Y = \mathbb R\), \(V = \{1, 4, 9, 16, 25\}\) which we know the fact that \(V \subseteq Y\), and \(f : x \rightarrow x^{2}\).</p>
<p>Using the definition:</p>
\[
f^{-1}(V) = \{x \in X : f(x) \in V\}
\]
<p>We can create a few equations that can help us generating the set:</p>
\[
x^{2} = 1
\]
\[
x^{2} = 4
\]
\[
x^{2} = 9
\]
\[
x^{2} = 16
\]
\[
x^{2} = 25
\]
<p>And solving these equations gives the following solutions:</p>
\[
x^{2} = 1; x = \pm 1
\]
\[
x^{2} = 4; x = \pm 2
\]
\[
x^{2} = 9; x = \pm 3
\]
\[
x^{2} = 16; x = \pm 4
\]
\[
x^{2} = 25; x = \pm 5
\]
<p>And we can write our solution to the inverse image of the set \(V\) being the following:</p>
\[
\{-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5\}
\]

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I wanted to understand more about the ideas of images as an avenue to understand bundles.</p>
<h3 id="the_basics_on_the_images_of_elements">The Basics on the Images of Elements</h3>
<p>If there is some element \(x \in X\), and some function \(f\), the image of \(x\) under \(f\) &#40;i.e. the image of the element&#41;, is the value of \(f\) applied to \(x\): </p>
\[
im(x) = f(x)
\]
<p>In other words, I would read this as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given some element \(x\), its image is whatever \(f\) maps \(x\) to – the function&#39;s output for \(x\).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>Let \(x = 4\) and \(f : x \rightarrow \sqrt{x}\). What is the image of \(x\)?</p>
<p>Using the definition:</p>
\[
im(x) = f(x)
\]
<p>We can then know: </p>
\[
im(x) = f(4) = 2
\]
<h3 id="the_basics_on_the_images_of_subsets">The Basics on the Images of Subsets</h3>
<p>Given \(f : X \rightarrow Y\) and \(W \subseteq X\), the image of \(W\) under \(f\) is:</p>
\[
im(f(W)) = f(W) = \{f(x) | x \in W \}
\]
<p>How I might read this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we have two sets, \(X\) and \(Y\), and a subset \(W \subseteq X\) &#40;a subset of \(X\)&#41; while also having a function that maps values of \(X\) to \(Y\) and we want to know the image of the subset, \(W\), we can have \(f\) operate on each element \(x \in W\). This generates the image of \(W\)&#33;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="example__2">Example</h4>
<p>Let \(X = \mathbb R\), \(Y = +\mathbb R\), \(W = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) and \(f : x \rightarrow x^{2}\). What is the image of \(W\) under \(f\)?</p>
<p>Using the generic definition:</p>
\[
im(f(W)) = f(W) = \{f(x) | x \in W \}
\]
<p>We can then write the set as follows:</p>
\[
im(f(W)) = \{1, 4, 9, 16, 25\}
\]
<h3 id="the_basics_on_the_images_of_functions">The Basics on the Images of Functions</h3>
<p>If we have two sets, \(X\) and \(Y\), and a function \(f : X \rightarrow Y\) which sends \(x \in X\) to \(Y\), the image of this function &#40;denoted \(im(f)\)&#41;, is:</p>
\[
im(f) = \{f(x) | x \in X\} \subseteq Y
\]
<p>So, what does that mean or how do we read this? In short, I would read this as: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given \(x\) as an element in \(X\), the image of the function \(f\) are the values that \(x\) is mapped to in \(Y\) via \(f\). Because each value is mapped to the domain \(Y\), those values form a subset of \(Y\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explanation may look familiar as the image of a function is actually synonymous to a function&#39;s range&#33; 😱 Typically though, to be a bit more rigorous, the word <em>range</em> is not used in this setting but rather <em>image</em>.</p>
<h4 id="example__3">Example</h4>
<p>Let \(X = \mathbb R\), \(Y = +\mathbb R\), and \(f : x \rightarrow x^{2}\). What is the image of \(f\)?</p>
<p>Using the generic definition:</p>
\[
im(f) = \{f(x) | x \in X\} \subseteq Y
\]
<p>We can then write the set as follows:</p>
\[
im(f) = \{0, ..., .01, ..., 25, ..., \infin\} \subseteq Y
\]
<p>In this example, based on the definition we have for an \(im(f)\), the \(im(f)\) is all possible outputs that \(f\) can generate which is the <em>range</em> \(+\mathbb R\).</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>This is a question to clarify my understand of coproducts as I have largely spent some time in understanding what they are and how to interpret them. </p>
<h3 id="question">Question</h3>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I was hoping I could get some clarification on my understanding of coproducts as I <em>believe</em> I have finally wrapped my head around them, but I want to be clear that I do.  To understand coproducts, I started with the set theory definition of a coproduct: </p>
\[
\bigcup_{i \in I} \{(x, i): x \in A_{i}\}
\]
<p>where \(i \in I\) denotes indexing from some <em>index set</em>, \(I\), using the index term, \(i\) and \(A_{i}\) represents some <em>family of sets</em> indexed by \(i\) and \(x\) is some element of the respective \(A_{i}\) set. Then, based on readings from Category Theory texts, I have gathered that the following is equivalent notation to the formal set theory definition: \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\).  As an example to make sure I am on the right track, here is a small simple problem and its solution according to my understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\) given the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
\[
> I = \{1, 2, 3\}
> \]
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
\[
> A = \{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{2, 4, 6\}\}
> \]
<blockquote>
<p>Solution: \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i} = \{(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2)\}\)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where I am confused is the following: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the difference between \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\) and \(\coprod_{i \in I} A_{i}\) and \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2}\) syntax notation &#40;the latter notation concerns two specific sets&#41;?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have seen all notations when referring to coproducts when viewed from both set theory and category theory perspectives. Is it a matter of aesthetic or is there a functional/semantic difference occurring?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>I have read that coproducts are also known as disjoint unions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I read about disjoint unions from a set theory perspective and also a category theory perspective but cannot really discern a functional &#40;i.e. practical&#41; difference from coproducts. Are coproducts and disjoint unions really effectively the same idea?</p>
<p>Thanks all and let me know if I can clarify anywhere&#33; </p>

<h3 id="variable_scope">Variable Scope</h3>
<h4 id="global_scope">Global Scope</h4>
<p>All variables within lua are considered global by default. Moreover, each call or line within a lua script is run as a chunk.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Var &#61; 10
print&#40; &quot;Global var:&quot;, Var &#41;</code></pre>
<h4 id="local_scope">Local Scope</h4>
<p>To define a large chunk where variables are local in scope, one can create a local scope using a do-end block </p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">do
	local Var &#61; 20
	print&#40; &quot;Local Var:&quot;, Var &#41;
end</code></pre>

B, C &#61; 0, 0 -- This works
B &#61; C &#61; 0 -- This does not work</code></pre>
<h3 id="variable_types">Variable Types</h3>
<p>There are eight basic types within Lua: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>nil</code> - represents absence of data</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>boolean</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>number</code> - <code>integer</code> and <code>float</code> both exist as alternative subtypes of <code>number</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>string</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>userdata</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>function</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>thread</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>table</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-lua">print&#40; type&#40;&quot;Hello&quot;&#41; &#41; -- string 
print&#40; type&#40;10.4 * 3&#41; &#41; -- number 
print&#40; type&#40;&#123;1, 2, 3&#125;&#41; &#41; -- table

print&#40; type&#40;true&#41; &#41; -- boolean 
print&#40; type&#40;nil&#41; &#41; -- nil</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Arithmetic operations applied to an object of type <code>string</code> will not fail but instead Lua will attempt to convert that object to a <code>number</code> type.  Vice-versa to this is that if a object of type <code>number</code> is used in a <code>string</code> operation, Lua will attempt to convert that object to a <code>string</code>.</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I was very confused about nomenclature concerning indexed sets and how to interpret them.</p>
<h3 id="building_an_intuition_for_index_sets">Building an Intuition for Index Sets</h3>
<p>An index set \(I\) can be nearly anything. The following examples build intuition to that statement:</p>
<h4 id="union_example_where_i_is_a_finite_set_of_integers">Union Example Where \(I\) Is a Finite Set of Integers</h4>
<p>For example, to build an initial intuition on what an index set actually is, we can imagine it as a set of integers. For the following problem, let&#39;s find the union of three different sets using the index set \(I\): </p>
<p>Let the following hold:</p>
\[
I = \{1, 2, 3\}
\]
\[
A_{1} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
\]
\[
A_{2} = \{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\}
\]
\[
A_{3} = \{-4, -2, 0, 2, 4\}
\]
<p>The intersection of these three sets can be denoted as follows: \(\bigcup_{i \in I} A_{i}\). This syntax is also synonymous with the following syntax that may be more easily read: \(\bigcup_{i=1}^{3} A_{i}\).  Either syntax means loosely, &quot;create the union between sets \(A_{1}\) through \(A_{n}\).&quot; The solution to this problem would be:</p>
\[
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_{i} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{3} A_{i} = \{-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2,3, 4, 5\}
\]
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: \(A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}\) are independent sets and do not form a family of sets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="union_example_where_i_is_a_countably_infinite_set_of_integers">Union Example Where \(I\) Is a Countably Infinite Set of Integers</h4>
<p>For example, one can also have an index set be infinite&#33; 😱 For the following problem, let&#39;s find the union of three different sets using the index set \(I\): </p>
<p>Let the following hold:</p>
\[
I = \N = \{1, 2, 3, \dots \}
\]
\[
A_{i} = \{-i, 0, i\}
\]
<p>In this case, \(A_{i}\) is a condition that prescribes the formation of independent sets.  So from \(A_{i}\) we could get the following sets using the infinite index set, \(I\):</p>
<p>:\(A*{i} = {-i, 0, i} =  \begin{cases} 	A*{1} = {-1, 0, 1}, i = 1 \
	A*{2} = {-2, 0, 2}, i = 2 \
	A*{3} = {-3, 0, 3}, i = 3 \
	\phantom{––} \dots \end{cases} :\)</p>
<p>The solution to this is as follows:</p>
\[
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_{i} = \bigcup_{i \in 1}^{\N} A_{i} = \Z
\]
<h4 id="union_example_where_i_is_an_interval">Union Example Where \(I\) Is an Interval</h4>
<p>Another form of index sets can be that they emerge over a interval and not discretely defined values – which sounds a bit terrifying at first&#33; 🤯 So, to delve into this, let&#39;s consider:</p>
<p>Let the following hold true:</p>
\[
I = [-1, 1]
\]
\[
A_{i} = \{i\} \times [0, 1]
\]
<p>, where \(A_{i}\) is a subset of \(\mathbb R^{2}\) &#40;i.e. \(A_{i} \subseteq R^{2}\)&#41;.</p>
<p>If we ask what is the union of \(A_{i}\), given that \(I\) is uncountably infinite, the answer would be: </p>
\[
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_{i} = [-1, 1] \times [0, 1]
\]

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I am having trouble reading some set theoretic notation. Hoping by gaining better familiarity with family of sets, I can understand notation better. </p>
<h3 id="family_of_sets">Family of Sets</h3>
<p>In brief, a family of sets could be the following:</p>
<p><strong>Definition 1:</strong> A family of sets, \(F\), could be a set of subsets over a set \(X\). An example of this would be the following scenario:</p>
<p>Let \(X = {1, 2, 3, 4}\)</p>
\[
F = \{\{\emptyset\}, \{1, 2 \},\{3, 4\}\}
\]
\[
F
\]
<p>is non-exhaustive as there could be more subsets derived from \(X\).</p>
<p><strong>Definition 2:</strong> A family of sets, \(F\), could be a set of sets where each set is independent from the others. An example of this would be the following scenario:</p>
<p>Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\), \(B = \{4, 5, 6\}\), and \(C = \{2, 4, 6\}\)</p>
\[
F = \{A, B, C\} = \{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{4, 5, 6\}, \{2, 4, 6\}\}

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I wanted to learn more about algebraic topology so as to further understand the notion of cross products. Cross products are albeit a simple mechanism but I was curious to see the notion of them pop up so much. Much more so seeing the idea propagate to topologies which sparked my interested about topologies.</p>
<h3 id="topological_spaces">Topological Spaces</h3>
<p>A topological space, to my understanding is a kind of embellished set.  Embellished in the sense that there exists an underlying set wherein a topology enriches the set. In short, a topology, \(\tau\), on a nonempty set \(X\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) that also belong to \(\tau\). These subsets are referred to as &quot;open sets&quot; where:</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
\[
    \emptyset
    \]
<p>and &#36;X&#36; are open. Also can be defined as &#36;\emptyset, X \in \tau&#36;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Union of any number of open sets within \(\tau\) also belong to \(\tau\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Intersection of a defined number of open sets in \(\tau\) also belong to \(\tau\)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If these conditions are met, then a topology \(\tau\) on \(X\) is often written as \((X, \tau)\). If \(\tau\) or the fact that we are working with topologies is obvious, then one can refer to \((X, \tau)\) as the &quot;topology on \(X\)&quot;. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If there are two sets, \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\), the notation \(A \backslash B\) &#40;read as &quot;A drop B&quot;&#41; is equal to \(A \backslash B = \{1\}\). This notation is shorthand for \(A \cap B^{c}\). In this case, this set would be known as a closed set under \((X, \tau)\).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="examples_of_topologies_on_a_set_x">Examples of Topologies on a Set \(X\)</h3>
<h4 id="trivial_indiscrete_topology_on_x">Trivial &#40;Indiscrete&#41; Topology on \(X\)</h4>
<p>If \(X = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) then the trivial topology is \(\tau = \{\{\}, \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\} = \{\emptyset, X\}\}\).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: In this case, \(\tau = \{\emptyset, X\}\}\) is referred to as a &quot;family&quot;. A &quot;family&quot; is a set of subsets for a given set &#40;in this case, \(X\)&#41;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="general_topology_on_x">General Topology on \(X\)</h4>
<p>If \(X = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) then the family \(\tau = \{\emptyset, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}, \{2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\}, X\}\) forms another topology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: &quot;General&quot; in the header for this section just refers to possible subsets that can be formed out of the set \(X\) to form another topology. Additional subsets could be \(\{1\}, \{1, 4\}\), etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the_discrete_topology_of_x">The Discrete Topology of \(X\)</h4>
<p>If \(x = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\), the discrete topology of \(X\) is the power set of \(X\) which is the family \(\tau = \wp(X)\). \(\wp(X)\) consists of all possible subsets of \(X\).</p>
<p>A simple way of calculating the power set of this topology is with the Julia snippet: </p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">using Combinatorics℘ &#61; powerset
X &#61; &#91;1, 2, 3, 4&#93;
℘&#40;X&#41; |&gt; collect</code></pre>
<p>Which would give the following possible subsets of X:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">&#91;&#93;,
&#91;1&#93;,
&#91;2&#93;,
&#91;3&#93;,
&#91;4&#93;,
&#91;1, 2&#93;,
&#91;1, 3&#93;,
&#91;1, 4&#93;,
&#91;2, 3&#93;,
&#91;2, 4&#93;,
&#91;3, 4&#93;,
&#91;1, 2, 3&#93;,
&#91;1, 2, 4&#93;,
&#91;1, 3, 4&#93;,
&#91;2, 3, 4&#93;,
&#91;1, 2, 3, 4&#93;</code></pre>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>To learn and understand the concept of coproducts within the context of category theory. Also, I came across the symbolic notation for what disjoint unions are and wanted to understand what the notation fully meant.</p>
<h3 id="disjoint_union_of_sets_intuition">Disjoint Union of Sets Intuition</h3>
<p>To build an intuitive sense of what a disjoint union is, consider the following.</p>
<p>Given two sets, \(X = \{a, b, c, d\}\), \(Y = \{1, 2, 3\}\), the coproduct of these sets would be: </p>
\[
X \coprod Y := \{a, b, c, d, 1, 2, 3\}
\]
<p>This also is referred to as the &quot;disjoint union of sets&quot;. Although, it is important to note that an important aspect of this notation above is missing from the coproduct which will be explained in the section on a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/#coproduct-of-a-set-and-itself">coproduct of a set and itself</a>.</p>
<h3 id="coproduct_of_a_set_and_itself">Coproduct of a Set and Itself</h3>
<p>If given set \(X = \{a, b, c, d\}\), the coproduct of \(X\) and itself would look like this:</p>
\[
X \coprod X \cong \{i_{1}a, i_{1}b, i_{1}c, i_{1}d, i_{2}a, i_{2}b, i_{2}c, i_{2}d\}
\]
<p>In this case, \(i_{1}\) and \(i_{2}\) are unique inclusion functions that map each set in a coproduct to its disjoint union. The inclusion functions in my opinion, act as a sort of metadata that helps one know where elements of a disjoint union comes from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: The author, David Spivak, in <em>Category Theory for the Sciences</em> presented the above notation for a coproduct of \(X\) and itself.  Personally, I found this notation very confusing and feel the formal set theory definition explained in the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/#set-theory-definition">section on the set theory definition of a coproduct</a> to be more useful here.  If we revisited the operation \(X \coprod X\), I am more inclined to write the problem and solution as follows:</p>
<p>Let \(X = X_{1} = X_{2}\), the value of \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2}\) is: \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2} \cong \{(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 1), (d, 1), (a, 2), (b, 2), (c, 3), (d, 4)\}\)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="set_theory_definition">Set Theory Definition</h3>
<p>This big honking formulation is the formal set theoretic definition of a coproduct:</p>
\[
\bigsqcup_{i \in I} A_{i} = \bigcup_{i \in I} \{(x, i): x \in A_{i}\}
\]
<p>What this says loosely is that given a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/09302022033236-family-sets.md">family of sets</a> \(A\) indexed by the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/09302022040126-indexed-sets.md">index set \(I\)</a>, a coproduct is a set that enumerates every element in \(A_{i}\) with its associated set. Referencing the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/#coproduct-of-a-set-and-itself">example on a coproduct of a set and itself</a>:</p>
<p>Given: \(X = \{a, b, c, d\}\)</p>
<p>Let \(X = X_{1} = X_{2}\), the value of \(X_{1} \coprod X_{2}\) is: </p>
\[
X_{1} \coprod X_{2} \cong \{(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 1), (d, 1), (a, 2), (b, 2), (c, 3), (d, 4)\}
\]
<p>The coproduct is a set which enumerates every element in both set \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) as a tuple with an associated index to say what set this element originated from &#40;i.e. \((a, 1)\) is the same \(a\) from set \(X_{1}\)&#41;.</p>
<h3 id="notation_in_category_theory">Notation in Category Theory</h3>
<p>It is important to make clear that in category theory, these two syntaxes are seen:</p>
\[
\coprod_{i \in I} X_{i}
\]
<p>and \(\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_{i}\)</p>
<p>Both refer to a disjoint union and both can be read as &quot;the disjoint union of the family of sets \(X_{i}\) indexed by the index set, \(I\).&quot; Here, when we say <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//09302022033236-family-sets.md">&quot;family of sets&quot;, they can either be a &quot;set of subsets over a set \(X\)&quot; or a &quot;set of sets \(X\) where each set could be independent of one another.&quot;</a></p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>Streaming is an immensely important concept I have consistently found. I came to appreciate the concept more deeply by interacting with <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://juliaio.github.io/TranscodingStreams.jl/stable/">TranscodingStreams.jl</a> to parse terabytes worth of data out of memory in a JSON format &#40;shudders at the thought of this&#41;.</p>
<p>Once your data is stored in files, data lakes, or data warehouses, it becomes historical data.</p>
<p>Streaming data refers to data that is still flowing through a system, e.g. moving from one microservice to another.</p>
<p>Historical data is often processed in batch jobs — jobs that are kicked off periodically. For example, once a day, you might want to kick off a batch job to generate recommendations for all users. When data is processed in batch jobs, we refer to it as batch processing.</p>
<p>Stream processing refers to doing computation on streaming data.</p>
<p>Batch prediction means periodically generating predictions offline, before prediction requests arise.</p>
<p>Online prediction means generating predictions on-demand, after prediction requests arise.</p>
<p>One of the features you might use is the average price of all the items this user has looked at in the last 30 minutes. This is an online feature – it needs to be computed on online data &#40;as opposed to being pre-computed on historical data&#41;</p>
<p>This “easy” way is stateless, which means that each computation is independent from the previous one.</p>
<p>Stateful stream processing can avoid redundancy, hence faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>Batch monitoring means running a script to compute the metrics you care about periodically &#40;like once a day&#41;, usually on data in warehouses like S3, BigQuery, Snowflake, etc. Batch monitoring is slow. You first have to wait for data to arrive at warehouses, then wait for the script to run.</p>
<p>Real-time monitoring means computing metrics on data as it arrives, allowing you to get insights into your systems in &#40;near&#41; real-time.</p>
<p>Continual learning refers to the ability to update your models whenever needed and to deploy this update quickly.</p>
<p>Overtime, we’ll have a series of ordered updates, which is called a log. Each update is an example of an event. Logs are append-only. You can only append the new events to your existing log. You can’t overwrite previous events.</p>
<p>There are two components of a streaming system: the realtime transport and the computation engine. The real-time transport, which are basically distributed logs.</p>
<p>The computation engine performs computation &#40;e.g. joining, aggregation, filtering, etc.&#41; on the data being transported.</p>
<p>The total price and the count constitute the internal state of the stream processing job.</p>
<p>The saved internal state is called a checkpoint &#40;or savepoint&#41;, and this job can resume from any checkpoint.</p>
<p>The computed average price value, if saved, will become a materialized view of the feature average price.</p>
<p>Or you can update it using only the new information &#40;e.g. using the latest materialized average price &#43; the prices of updated items&#41;. The latter is called incremental materialized.</p>
<p>Point-in-time correctness refers to a system’s ability to accurately perform a computation as it would’ve happened at any time in the past. Point-in-time correctness means no data leakage.</p>
<p>Retroactively processing historical data using a different logic is also called backfilling.</p>
<p>With batch backfilling, you can apply the new logic &#40;e.g. new feature definition&#41; to a table in the past.</p>
<p>With stream backfilling, you can apply the new logic to the log in a given period of time in the past, e.g. apply it to the log on June 10, 2022.</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I read this paper to find out more about the social vulnerability index and how it can be used in the state of Georgia. It wasn&#39;t particularly insightful although the discussion about calculating SVI for GA and its definition about social vulnerability was helpful.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>Social vulnerability is defined as the extent to which a community contains social characteristics that may affect the community&#39;s overall resilience &#40;18&#41;. It is affected by 	- Situational factors: Employment, Education, Income, Housing Type &#40;19, 20&#41; 	- Intrinsic factors: Age, Race, and Ethnicity &#40;19, 21&#41;</p>

<p>I never knew the term for this but historically, where African Americans were heavily enslaved is called the &quot;Black Belt&quot;. The authors found that high SVI and heat-related deaths were often found in these historical communities &#91;32&#93;.</p>

<h3 id="reading_movation">Reading Movation</h3>
<p>I wanted to read this paper to get more a sense for vulnerable populations. Although I was less interested in the specific applications to rural communities, I found the discussion around rural vulnerabilities very interesting as well as clarification around definitions.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_vulnerability">What Is Vulnerability?</h3>
<p>Vulnerable populations are those subgroups that are at risk for experiencing elevated healthcare disparities. &#40;De Chesnay &amp; Anderson, 2016; Shi &amp; Stevens, 2010&#41;.</p>
<p>A potential model to assess vulnerability is that proposed by &#40;Grabovschi et al., 2013&#41; where it can be visaulized as a right triangle with the horizontal axis representing healthcare accessibility and quality; vertical axis represents healthcare needs; hypotenuse is the level of vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="barriers_often_encountered_in_rural_healthcare_settings">Barriers Often Encountered in Rural Healthcare Settings</h3>
<p>Health disparities continue to be a severe problem across US populations. &#40;Crosby, Wendel, Vanderpool, &amp; Casey, 2012; Penman-Aguilar et al., 2016&#41; Trends in inequalities emerge for patients seeking healthcare across multiple factors such as race, socioeconomic status, and provider accessibility.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rural dwellers tend to lack insurance compared to urban settings &#40;Barker, Londeree, McBride, Kemper, &amp; Mueller, 2013; Soni, Hendryx, &amp; Simon, 2017&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many rural dwellers travel more than 30 minutes for healthcare - it is especially exacerbated where public transportation is lacking and severe poverty exists &#40;Warren &amp; Smalley, 2014, p. xiii&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities_most_often_studied_in_rural_health_literature">Vulnerabilities Most Often Studied in Rural Health Literature</h3>
<p>46 articles were studied for this systematic review. Population sizes ranged from 10 to 30,874 people. For quantitative studies, populations ranged from 28 to 30,874 participants.</p>

<h3 id="recommendations_for_future_research">Recommendations for Future Research</h3>
<p>Only one article calculated a power analysis &#40;Komro et al., 2015&#41;.</p>
<p>Power analysis are used in quantitative research to limit error between hypothesis and findings.</p>
<p>There was observed an overrelianceon descriptive correlational designs that impeded adequate theory testing. Studies should incorporate theories and theoretical applications relevant to rural populations.</p>

<h1>Setting Up Julia LSP for Neovim</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> August 31 2022</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> An explanation of how to setup the Julia LSP for Neovim</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##summary #neovim #julia #programming #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>

<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>General Guide</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="general_guide">General Guide</h3>
<p>This is from Fredrik Ekre at the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://discourse.julialang.org/t/neovim-languageserver-jl/37286/72?u&#61;thecedarprince">Julia Discourse</a> with some minimal changes and notes from me:</p>
<p>LanguageServer is somewhat slow to start so it is very useful to use a custom sysimage using PackageCompiler to reduce this time. On my machine I get the first response after 20&#43; seconds, but with a custom sysimage I can execute LS commands instantaneously.</p>
<p>Here is my setup:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install <code>Mason.nvim</code> or <code>nvim-lspconfig</code> and install <code>julials</code> &#40;it may also be called something like Julia Language Server Protocol&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modify <code>init.vim</code> or <code>init.lua</code> to use a custom Julia executable &#40;if it exists&#41;:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-lua">require&#39;lspconfig&#39;.julials.setup&#123;
    on_new_config &#61; function&#40;new_config, _&#41;
        local julia &#61; vim.fn.expand&#40;&quot;~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig/bin/julia&quot;&#41;
        if require&#39;lspconfig&#39;.util.path.is_file&#40;julia&#41; then
	    vim.notify&#40;&quot;Hello&#33;&quot;&#41;
            new_config.cmd&#91;1&#93; &#61; julia
        end
    end
&#125;</code></pre>
<p>&#40;OPTIONAL&#41; If you use Packer to manage your vim setup, run <code>PackerCompile</code>.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you notice, there is a small line named <code>vim.notify&#40;&quot;Hello&#33;&quot;&#41;</code>. This is to test that <code>julials</code> is engaged when accessing a Julia file - you can check that it is engaged by writing <code>:messages</code> in vim. You should see &quot;Hello&#33;&quot; appear. This line can then safely be removed. </p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Create the <code>nvim-lspconfig</code> Julia environment by running the following in your shell:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-sh">julia --project&#61;~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig -e &#39;using Pkg; Pkg.add&#40;&quot;LanguageServer&quot;&#41;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>And then navigate to the directory at <code>~.julia/environment/nvim-lspconfig</code>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Copy the following makefile &#40;<a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://github.com/fredrikekre/.dotfiles/blob/master/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig/Makefile">courtesy of Fredrik Ekre</a>&#41; the <code>nvim-lspconfig</code> directory with the name <code>makefile</code>:</p>
</li>
</ol>

#
# This Makefile can be used to build a custom Julia system image for LanguageServer.jl to
# use with neovims built in LSP support. An up-to date version of this Makefile can be found
# at https://github.com/fredrikekre/.dotfiles/blob/master/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig/Makefile
#
# Usage instructions:
#
#   1. Update the neovim configuration to use a custom julia executable. If you use
#      nvim-lspconfig &#40;recommended&#41; you can modify the setup call to the following:
#
#          require&#40;&quot;lspconfig&quot;&#41;.julials.setup&#40;&#123;
#              on_new_config &#61; function&#40;new_config, _&#41;
#                  local julia &#61; vim.fn.expand&#40;&quot;~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig/bin/julia&quot;&#41;
#                  if require&#40;&quot;lspconfig&quot;&#41;.util.path.is_file&#40;julia&#41; then
#                      new_config.cmd&#91;1&#93; &#61; julia
#                  end
#              end,
#              -- ...
#          &#125;&#41;
#
#   2. Place this Makefile in ~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig &#40;create the directory if
#      it doesn&#39;t already exist&#41;.
#
#   3. Change directory to ~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig and run &#96;make&#96;. This will
#      start up neovim in a custom project with a julia process that recods compiler
#      statements. Follow the instructions in the opened source file, and then exit neovim.
#
#   4. Upon exiting neovim PackageCompiler.jl will compile a custom system image which will
#      automatically be used whenever you work on Julia projects in neovim.
#
# Update instructions:
#
#  To update the system image &#40;e.g. when upgrading Julia or upgrading LanguageServer.jl or
#  it&#39;s dependencies&#41; run the following commands from the
#  ~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig directory:
#
#      julia --project&#61;. -e &#39;using Pkg; Pkg.update&#40;&#41;&#39;
#      makeJULIA&#61;&#36;&#40;shell which julia&#41;

<h3 id="what_is_terrorism">What Is Terrorism?</h3>
<p>Terrorism is defined as the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Terrorism is not an individual experience; it is violence at a population level and worthy of attention in fields focusing on socioecological understanding of social processes and human behavior <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08192022115354-health-terrorism-factors.md">Social Determinants of Health, Violent Radicalization, and Terrorism: A Public Health Perspective</a>. Often the threat of violence – is enough to accomplish an objective &#40;this holds true often for terrorist groups as well&#41;.</p>

<p>Jihad is a major teaching in Islam and is often confused in modern discussion of contemporary Islam. It is often simplistically translated in English to mean, &quot;holy war&quot;. However, it has a much deeper meaning relating to the notion of struggling for the sake of God.</p>

<p>I personally only found this paper mildly interesting. In my research in terrorism, I was not as interested in this sort of research literature as it was too granular for what I was investigating – which was a broad level of investigation as an initial pass.</p>
<p>Their biggest takeaway from their study was that they found contrary to mainstream literature now, there is a socioeconomic impact to account for when researching terrorism. This especially extends the poor socioeconomic conditions individuals find themselves in such as insufficient welfare policies, economic discrimination, and low levels of economic openness. &#40;e.g., Burgoon, 2006; Blomberg and Hess, 2008; Krieger and Meierrieks, 2010; Caruso and Schneider, 2011&#41; Additionally, to fight terrorism, they surmised that improving socioeconomic conditions could in fact counter terrorist growth. </p>

<p>A. Spataro, &quot;Why Do People Become Terrorists?: A Prosecutor’s Experiences,&quot; Journal of International Criminal Justice, vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 507–524, Jul. 2008, doi: 10.1093/jicj/mqn033.</p>

<p>Interesting comment in this paper about how convicted terrorists will harken back their cause to injustice suffered by those they perceive as having a special kinship with. Also, ideological motives do come up but the similarity piece appears more important than holding the same values.</p>
<p>Motivations for becoming a terrorist:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Search for community belonging</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attempt to reaffirm identity</p>
</li>
<li><p>Search for prestige through &quot;strong&quot; leaders of communities 6</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A powerful quote from this paper is that, &quot;Modern Islamic terrorists are made, not born.&quot; There are routes from which would-be extremists come from:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Could start that something is wrong and needs to be corrected</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is perceived that the problem cannot be solved with means provided by a society&#39;s political or legal framework</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accepting an ideology or developing a worldview that breaks down the barriers that stop most from committing acts of violence to be overcome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The moment when individuals &quot;can conceive of... acts of appalling brutality...&quot; &#40;Burke, supranote 2, at 247-248&#41;.</p>
<p>H. Shmuel Erlich, &#39;Reflections on the Terrorist Mind, in Varvin and Volkan, ibid., chap. 9, states how the psyche of a terrorist&#39;s mind &#39;is not marked by gross deviance&#39;, and &#39;the attempt to depict &quot;the Terrorist&quot; as a deranged, emotionally deprived and impoverished, mentally ill person is misleading and basically wrong&#39; &#40;at 148&#41;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This is a fascinating note that many terrorists are not apparently &quot;crazy&quot; or terribly psychologically deranged but rather is misleading</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the relationship that inevitably takes shape with the collaborators with justice, I have at times been struck by the astonishment and gratitude with which they welcomed even simple gestures of courtesy or human interest on my part, which were evidently interpreted as signs, almost as proof, of the existence of a personal relationship of acceptance and sympathy. It is something they marvel at and do not seem to have expected. This means that the Public Prosecutor does not become just the collaborator&#39;s reference point in the course of the criminal proceedings awaiting him, which are often long and complex. The Public Prosecutor also becomes the addressee of a trust that projects beyond the judicial occasion and concerns the future of that person.</p>
<p>One final note that was highlighted by this collection of perspectives was the fact that terrorists who collaborate on behalf of justice enjoy the apparent friendship that can be struck up with the public prosecutor. To me, it highlights the importance of meeting the social needs of these terrorists or would-be terrorists as a means to prevent terrorism.</p>

<p>This paper was probably the best paper I have read on the subject of terrorism research and how it intersects with public health and the social determinants of health. It provided a comprehensive background on what terrorism and radicalism are as well as some very useful public health terminology introducing the concept of social cohesion and social capital. Furthermore, it got at the concept of how examining terrorism and gang violence from a public health perspective is very understudied and underutilized when exploring this space.</p>
<h3 id="public_health_approach_to_terrorism">Public Health Approach to Terrorism</h3>
<p>2.6&#37; of terrorism deaths happen in the West. 72&#37; belong to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Syria</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pakistan</p>
</li>
<li><p>Iraq</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nigeria</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afghanistan - Institute for Economics and Peace. Global Terrorism Index. New York, NY. 2015.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorism associated with negative mental health outcomes in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>depression</p>
</li>
<li><p>anxiety</p>
</li>
<li><p>posttraumatic stress disorder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amongst others - Rousseau C, Jamil U, Bhui K, et al. Consequences of 9/11 and the war on terror on children’s and young adult’s mental health: a systematic review of the past 10 years. Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2015;20:173–193.</p>
<h3 id="shortcomings_of_addressing_terrorism_from_a_public_health_perspective">Shortcomings of Addressing Terrorism from a Public Health Perspective</h3>
<p>Historically public health has focused on: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preparedness strategies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Containment of terrorist fallout</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What has been missing in this space is examining:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social determinants of terrorism</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determinants for violent radicalization</p>
</li>
<li><p>Risk factors for terrorism</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="factors_leading_to_extremism">Factors Leading to Extremism</h3>
<p>A case study from the United Kingdom shows that violent radicalization is an outcome of a complex interaction among social, political, cultural, historical, and interpersonal factors.7 </p>
<p>Discrimination can be thought of as a &quot;comorbidity&quot; of social isolation and exclusionary behavior. One form of systematic discrimination is immigration policy as it directly contributes to social segregation.9 Feelings of marginalization have been shown to lead to decreased self-worth and, in turn, increase radicalization.57 Those discriminated against could then fall easily to extremist influence and ideology as a result of weakening social cohesion.52</p>
<h3 id="studying_gang_violence_as_a_proxy_for_terrorist_groups">Studying Gang Violence as a Proxy for Terrorist Groups</h3>
<p>A proxy to study terrorism is to study gang violence</p>
<p>At the individual level, gangs and terrorist organizations appeal to individuals who are psychologically deviant, have limited access to socioeconomic opportunities, or are marginalized members of society.39–44 In fact, terrorist groups attract a range of unstable individuals.45</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This seems to contradict the paper <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08232022220130-people-become-terrorists.md">Why Do People Become Terrorists</a> as it notes that instead, it was observed how many of these people who are not fully psychologically deviant but rather of clear mind. Furthermore, in my attempt to reconcile such different observations, I would posit that rather, both explanations and comments are valid but that &quot;unstable individuals&quot; seem to conflate a kind of negative aspect to a person whereas the linked paper avoids the notion of unstable persons and instead explains how most of these people are of clear opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goals generally exclusive to gangs:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Symbolic ends</p>
</li>
<li><p>Looser structure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Less temporary collaborations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shorter memberships</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gang occupies physical space.46</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference between gangs and terrorist groups is that gangs are often not politically motivated.47 </p>

<p>Dutch police actively sought to integrate individuals from Syria by connecting them with a psychiatrist or mentor. Then, they provided assistance to find housing or means to return to school. To round out this reintegration process, they went even further to provide &quot;whatever they needed to fully integrate back into society.&quot;67 </p>
<p>This approach, believes that to fight terrorism through policing and/or &quot;profiling&quot; will create real or perceived discrimination, humiliation, and/or marginalization. Other papers have shown <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08232022220130-people-become-terrorists.md">this to be an accurate assessment</a>.</p>

<p>Muslim Americans who come from the Middle East are often classified as &quot;White&quot; by categories set forth by the Office of Management and Budget. However, this is in complete opposition to the fact that a large proportion of Muslim Americans do not identify as &quot;White&quot;. 15 An implicit assumption and implicit problem is that people labeled &quot;White&quot; are assumed to be &quot;racially neutral.&quot;15 </p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I wanted to read this article as it was highly recommended to me by my friend, Jaan Altosaar, one of the coauthors of this piece. I was very interested in the methods they used and the approach they took to address fairness in phenotypes as although I had heard about discrepancies in phenotypes, this was a bit of a watershed paper to read in my mind exposing how phenotyping can be so skewed. Really fantastic paper and will be returning to it.</p>
<h3 id="purpose_of_paper">Purpose of Paper</h3>
<p>Biases introduced at phenotype level can risk exacerbating existing health disparities by influencing clinical guidelines and public policy is what this paper argues</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Phenotyping:</strong> Identifying a set of patients with a particular disease</p>
<p><strong>Phenotype Definitions:</strong> the process of sorting patients based on a disease they have into cohorts. This phenotyping to create definitions is done to learn more about a specific condition such as: 	- Epidemiological queries &#40;e.g., quantifying incidence of disease overtime&#41; &#40;Dubberke et al., 2012&#41; 	- Estimating and predicting risk &#40;Kaelber et al., 2012&#41;  	- Comparing effectiveness &#40;Suchard et al., 2019&#41;</p>
<p>The basis of demographic parity is the federal fourfths rule, which states that a selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than fourfths of the rate of the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact</p>
<h3 id="types_of_biases_found_in_phenotyping">Types of Biases Found in Phenotyping</h3>
<p><strong>Diagnosis Bias:</strong> a bias that prevents or causes delays to a disease diagnosis for a population due to differences in how that disease may present for that particular population. Example: 	- Heart attack literature finds that men complain of chest pain more frequently 	- Woman are likely to complain of other forms of pain. 	- Phenotype definition for heart attack with chest pain as the core symptom may not capture women &#40;Coventry et al., 2011&#41;.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment bias:</strong> a bias that prevents or causes delays to a treatment for population groups. Example: 	- VA black patients less likely to receive cardio-protective drugs than white patients &#40;Mehta et al., 2010 </p>
<p><strong>Access to Care Bias:</strong> biases that are systemic issues preventing patients from accessing healthcare options. Example: 	- Phenotype definition that requires a diagnosis to occur in outpatient settings could underrepresent patients.</p>
<h3 id="common_fairness_metrics">Common Fairness Metrics</h3>
<p><strong>Demographic Parity:</strong> difference in proportion for each protected class that receives the positive and negative outcome. Also referred to as &quot;independence&quot; or &quot;statistical parity&quot;.</p>
\[
P_0(\hat{Y}=\hat{y})=P_1(\hat{Y}=\hat{y}) \forall \hat{y} \in\{0,1\}
\]
<p><strong>Equality of Opportunity:</strong> when true positive rates of a model are equal across demographics</p>
\[
P_0(\hat{Y}=1 \mid Y=1)=P_1(\hat{Y}=1 \mid Y=1)
\]
<p><strong>Predictive Rate Parity:</strong> when probability of true labels given the predicted label is the same across classes</p>
\[
P_0(Y=1 \mid \hat{Y}=1)=P_1(Y=1 \mid \hat{Y}=1)
\]
<p>and </p>
\[
P_0(Y=0 \mid \hat{Y}=0)=P_1(Y=0 \mid \hat{Y}=0)
\]

<h3 id="what_is_normal_science">What Is &quot;Normal Science&quot;?</h3>
<p>According to Kuhn, <em>normal science</em>, is research based on past scientific accomplishments that are considered the foundation for that area of investigation. Generally, this is the area where most scientists spend their time. The research done in normal science can be theoretical or empirical.</p>
<p>In the book, Kuhn referred to this as &quot;mop-up work&quot; and that this mopping up or &quot;filling out&quot; of science is what most scientists do. Although language such as &quot;mop-up&quot; work can make one think that Kuhn was being pejorative to these so-called &quot;scut scientists&quot;, he did not intend it so. In later versions of this book, he made a response to this point of confusion and clarified that this work still is fascinating and crucial in many ways to the advancement of science.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_characteristics_of_normal_science">What Are the Characteristics of Normal Science?</h4>
<p>An important aspect of normal science is that it does not engage with or seek out anything new. The invention of theories, development of new phenomena - anything abnormal - is not part of normal science. Novelty is abhorrent and antithetical to normal science.</p>
<p>Aside from this fundamental aspect of normal science, Kuhn posited that there are three general areas of research in normal science. He emphasized that they do not always hold or are always discrete from one another:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Investigating questions around the fundamental facts found in a specific domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Questions that are predicted and expected to have answers existing within an already existing research domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Further articulating the fundamental facts held in a given domain.</p>

<h3 id="reading_motivation">Reading Motivation</h3>
<p>I had long heard about this author ever since high school. I recall one day picking up a book of his at my community college&#39;s library and being both interested and overwhelmed by it. I have never much read philosophy so this was my first time encountering such a book and at the time, I found it impenetrable beyond my preliminary glances. It wasn&#39;t until this year I ventured on a project to read his magnum opus, <em>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</em>, a nearly 400 page endeavor that spanned nearly 6 months.</p>
<p>I am sure for anyone more expert, they could&#39;ve more readily finished such a book. But, although I found MacLuhan&#39;s ideas very fascinating as well as largely approachable, I could only truly approach and appreciate them if I read his work in very small chunks. So, I worked slowly through this book and have not regretted doing so a single moment.  This book was utterly life changing and has wide implications for the modern day despite this book being written nearly 70 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="the_action_and_the_reaction">The Action and the Reaction</h3>
<p>MacLuhan puts forth an initial thought of the &quot;action and the reaction&quot;. He mentions how in past ages, actions &#40;particularly the development of novel technologies like of a better plow or even printing press&#41; could be executed with relatively minimal care. Not &quot;minimal&quot; in the sense of a lack of importance but that the impact of an action rippled much more slowly through the world. The action could be followed by a well-thought out or better informed reaction by those the action was affecting.</p>
<p>However, today, &quot;the action and the reaction occur almost &#91;simultaneously&#93;&quot;. The action and reaction to a technology used to be slow but now is instantly leaving behind those incapable of adapting to the novelty. As MacLuhan observed, this simultaneity prevents an acclimation period for persons as much of humanity continues to &quot;think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age.&quot; <a href="https://jacobzelko.com//12242022202340-relativity-information-gaps.md">I intentionally invoke the word &quot;simultaneity&quot; here as I think this concept of &quot;action and reaction&quot; finds analogy within Einstein&#39;s notion of Relativity of Simultaneity</a> TODO: Create note on Relativity of Simultaneity using this link: https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS<em>0410/chapters/Special</em>relativity<em>rel</em>sim/index.html and this one: https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/Goodies/rel<em>of</em>sim/index.html TODO: Create separate note on analogy between Relativity of Simultaneity and Information Dissemination</p>
<p>In the past, MacLuhan posits that we used technology to create &quot;extensions&quot; that &quot;extended&quot; parts of our bodies – like a knife extending our teeth or a firearm extending our fists. Not so in the electric era.  Rather, we have &quot;extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time&#91;.&#93;&quot; MacLuhan believes that we are rapidly approaching the point in society and technology wherein, &quot;the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human society. &#91;... Where&#93; it is no longer possible to adopt the aloof and dissociated role of the literate Westerner.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&#39;s business is now everyone&#39;s business.</p>
<h3 id="the_age_of_anxiety">The Age of Anxiety</h3>
<p>One idea that I think MacLuhan fantastically captured and explained much better than modern pundits and observers have done is how our age is one of anxiety. This has been bemoaned in many ways from multiple different groups – be they political, scientific or spiritual – but I have always found the notions being discussed to be buried too much in a specific domain or emerging trend. MacLuhan instead abstracts this concept to a much higher level that gives it, in my opinion, a much better resonance of the true problems of our electric age.</p>
<p>As he says, &quot;If the nineteenth century was the age of the editorial chair, ours is the century of the psychiatrist&#39;s couch.&quot; Something that was hard to grasp at first was the careful delineation he made between a &quot;chair&quot; and a &quot;couch&quot;. For him, the &quot;chair&quot; as an extension of man is a mechanical replacement of one&#39;s spine – a reinforcement to help the &quot;sitter&quot; maintain their position &#40;on an argument or view&#41;.  Instead, the modern &quot;couch&quot; becomes an icon that offers no such support but a sort of endless collapse into ease that thwarts &quot;the temptation to express private points of view and obviates the need to rationalize events.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Age of Anxiety for the reason of the electric implosion that compels commitment and participation, quite regardless of any &quot;point of view&quot;,&quot; is a line of thinking that links back this notion of the &quot;Age of Anxiety&quot; to his original idea on the &quot;action and the reaction&quot;. As man in an electric society can no longer be an observer, the &quot;point of view&quot; &#40;which I understand as one&#39;s own beliefs and thoughts about the world&#41; one may have becomes an obstacle to a global society. Using the means of a psychiatrist&#39;s couch, we can become numbed to even our own beliefs and mental facilities. Instead, the current zeitgeist is to allow our &quot;point of view&quot; fall congruent to the will of the masses and governing authorities.</p>
<p>And here MacLuhan utters his famous line: &quot;the globe is no more than a village,&quot; to illustrate how every problem, every action, every perspective, is now standing and staring at you and how <em>you</em> will act. &quot;It is this implosive factor that alters the position of &#91;various&#93; groups. They can no longer be contained, in the political sense of limited association. They are now involved in our lives, as we in theirs, thanks to the electric media.&quot; We are now obligated to some involvement regardless of one exact point of view.</p>
<p>And therein lies the core problem of this Age of Anxiety: conflicting views in the electric age lead to adversity. Because what if we say, do, or think something that goes askew the prevailing global &quot;point of view&quot;? At best, one could be described as &quot;quaint&quot; or &quot;old-fashioned&quot; perhaps; at worst, one could be excommunicated from the village.</p>
<h3 id="the_medium_is_the_message">The Medium Is the Message</h3>
<p>I think I will have to read more of MacLuhan&#39;s work someday to better understand the concept of &quot;medium&quot; but this is my very loose understanding. As MacLuhan cryptically says, &quot;the medium is the message,&quot; forming the key motif of this entire book. He builds upon earlier language around &quot;extensions&quot; to explain that the message conveyed by a medium consists of the &quot;personal and social consequences&quot; of a medium &#40;i.e. an extension&#41; that result from the scale introduced into our lives by each extension. In short, the message itself is the consequences of a medium that affect reality we inhabit.</p>
<p>In compliment to the &quot;message&quot; of a medium, the &quot;&#39;content&#39; of any medium is always another medium.&quot; When I first read this, I was rather confused as it seemed in contradiction to my earlier understanding of what the message of a medium is. However, what MacLuhan was more referring to as &quot;content&quot; is not again so much the actual &quot;information&quot; in the message but more the &quot;method&quot; of its communication such as the following line of examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LRSpeech --ContentOf--&gt; Writing</code></pre>
<p>Using MacLuhan&#39;s notion of the &quot;content&quot; of a medium, we see that &quot;speech&quot; is fundamentally the content of the medium, &quot;writing&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LRWriting --ContentOf--&gt; Print</code></pre>
<p>Then &quot;writing&quot; is the content of the medium of &quot;print&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LRPrint --ContentOf--&gt; Telegraph</code></pre>
<p>Finally, &quot;print&quot; is the content of the medium of the &quot;telegraph&quot;.  MacLuhan did point out that you could go even further from the root of &quot;speech&quot; to muscle contractions in one&#39;s throat, to thought, etc. However, I, as well as MacLuhan, found that to be a bit inane and I find it reasonable to call speech a &quot;fundamental&quot; content. It is a bit confusing how MacLuhan uses &quot;content&quot; in this scenario but to summarize my understanding of his central treatise on what he means by &quot;the medium is the message&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;&#91;The&#93; &#39;message&#39; of any medium &#91;...&#93; is the change &#91;...&#93; that it introduces into human affairs.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;&#91;T&#93;he medium &#91;...&#93; shapes and controls &#91;...&#93; human association and action.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;content&quot; of any medium is another medium</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the delineation between what is a &quot;medium&quot;, what is &quot;content&quot;, and what is a &quot;message&quot; is thorny to parse from MacLuhan&#39;s writing &#40;at least for me&#41;, I think this separation is wholly necessary. In fact, I think this delineation is what is missing from modern discourse on new mediums &#40;ergo technologies&#41;. In culmination of this initial discussion on mediums, I think the most important takeaway for me about mediums is this quote: &quot;it is only too typical that the &#39;content&#39; of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium.&quot; We can limit ourselves by only thinking within existing &quot;content&quot; of a given &quot;medium&quot; rather than viewing the medium wholly.</p>
<p>In short, new mediums enable entirely novel realities. Letters were once highly cherished not only because of their &quot;content&quot; &#40;i.e. the medium of writing and hand-writing&#41; and their &quot;information&quot; &#40;what did the letter say&#41; but also due to the constrained medium of a letter. Letters could take days or weeks to be delivered and would have to encapsulate much within their &quot;information&quot;. Now with the use of instant messaging, we have lost &quot;content&quot; &#40;i.e. hand-writing&#41; in this medium but it introduces an entirely new reality of interacting with the &quot;content&quot;. The &quot;information&quot; conveyed by the &quot;content&quot; of instant messaging can be trivialized much more easily due to the instantaneous nature of the &quot;medium&quot; of instant messaging.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics_of_a_medium">Characteristics of a Medium</h3>
<p>MacLuhan goes onto further explain the characteristics of a medium. &quot;General David Sarnoff made this statement: &quot;We are too prone to make technological instruments the scapegoats for the sins of those who wield them. The products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.&quot; That is the voice of the current somnambulism. Suppose we were to say, &quot;Apple pie is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used that determines its value.&quot; Or, &quot;The smallpox virus is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used that determines its value.&quot; Again, &quot;Firearms are in themselves neither good nor bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.&quot; That is, if the slugs reach the right people firearms are good.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 13&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;any medium has the power of imposing its own assumption on the unwary&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 17&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;greatest aid to this end is simply in knowing that the spell can occur immediately upon contact&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 17&#41;</p>
<p>Mediums are virulent. They can infect, inspire, and alter oneself all at once.</p>
<p>&quot;literate man is quite inclined to see others who cannot conform as somewhat pathetic&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 18&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;testers assume that uniform and continuous habits are a sign of intelligence, thus eliminating the ear man and the tactile man&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 18&#41;</p>
<p>Could it be said that these could be geniuses, those who do not conform?</p>
<p>The private point of view according to McLuhan is all at once an illusion as we become who we behold</p>
<p>How media affect or leach into a community should be the underlying area of study in examining the impacts of a media.</p>
<p>&quot;we are losing all confidence in our right to assign guilt&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 22&#41;</p>
<p>Assigning guilt is lost in the electric area. Calling anything wrong or crazy is impossible.</p>
<h3 id="types_of_mediums">Types of Mediums</h3>
<h4 id="hot_mediums">Hot Mediums</h4>
<p>&quot;A hot medium is one that extends one single sense in &quot;high definition.&quot; High definition is the state of being well filled with data.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 30&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;A photograph is, visually, &quot;high definition.&quot; A cartoon is &quot;low definition,&quot; simply because very little visual information is provided. Telephone is a cool medium. or one of low definition, because the ear is given a meager amount of information&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 30&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Hot media are, therefore, low in participation, and cool media are high in participation or completion by the audience&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 31&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;For myth is the instant vision of a complex process that ordinarily extends over a long period. Myth is contraction or implosion of any process, and the instant speed of electricity confers the mythic dimension on ordinary industrial and social&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 33&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;We are certainly coming within conceivable range of a world automatically controlled to the point where we could say, &quot;Six hours less radio in Indonesia next week or there will be a great falling off in literary attention.&quot; Or, &quot;We can &#33; program twenty more hours of TV in South Africa next week to cool down the tribal temperature raised by radio last week.&quot; Whole cultures could now be programmed to keep their emotional climate stable in the same way that we have begun to know something about maintaining equilibrium in the commercial economies of the world&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 36&#41; media based influence and control of ideas</p>
<h3 id="creation_of_new_systems">Creation of New Systems</h3>
<p>&quot;One of the most common causes of breaks in any system is the cross-fertilization with another system, such as happened to print with the steam press, or with radio and movies &#40;that yielded the talkies&#41;.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 49&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Except for light, all other media come in pairs, with one acting as the &quot;content&quot; of the other, obscuring the operation of both&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 63&#41;</p>
<p>McLuhan says that the artist is always the first person to make the intersection of mediums powerful. I wonder if that is so.</p>
<p>&quot;The moment of the meeting of media is a moment of freedom and release from the ordinary trance and numbness imposed by them on our senses.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 67&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;That is what is meant when we say that we daily know more and more about man. We mean that we can translate more and more of ourselves into other forms of expression that exceed ourselves. Man is a form of expression who is traditionally expected to repeat himself and to echo the praise of his Creator&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 69&#41;</p>
<p>I really like this idea that man itself is a type of expression. Meaning, translation is infinite.</p>
<p>He makes an interesting observation about people who are illiterate to this age. They afford technology a sort of tribal magic much like how inexperienced investors expect to make money by throwing funds into stock.</p>
<p>Missing the whole for the parts.</p>
<p>&quot;The artist is the man in any field, scientific or humanistic, who grasps the implications of his actions and of new knowledge in his own time&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 78&#41;</p>
<p>He goes into great detail about how the artists are the ones able to react to new technologies. Is is them who can express the groans of the current reality.</p>
<h3 id="surviving_an_impossible_world">Surviving an Impossible World</h3>
<p>&quot;it is obvious that numbness is the result of any prolonged terror&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 39&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The price of eternal vigilance is indifference.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 39&#41;</p>
<p>Autoamputation is an interesting thought. I was unsure what was meant at first but realize it is the process by which to externalize or remove an internal irritant through some kind of self extension.</p>
<p>The suicidal autoamputation is a more heinous variety where all experiences are external separate to the body. Makes me think of VR and Meta. He points out that this happens because we are not equipped to handle such extreme serialization.</p>
<p>A &quot;closure&quot; is the idea that a person conforms perceptually to a media they are immersed in - like Psalm 113. Finally, more of an explanation on what closures are. They are the worlds media make for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to numb our central nervous system when it is extended and exposed, or we will die&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 57&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Thus the age of anxiety and of electric media is also the age of the unconscious and of apathy.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 58&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Our private and corporate lives have become information processes just because we have put our central nervous systems outside us in electric technology.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 63&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The mark of our time is its revulsion against imposed patterns. We are suddenly eager to have things and people declare their beings totally.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 8&#41;</p>
<p>Is it wise that we have this revulsion against patterns? Rather, I find it a possible societal regression of a kind. Why do we say in hubris that we know now better to live than in any time of human history? Is man, unrestrained, really man or some primal, base thing?</p>
<h3 id="media_as_extensions_of_tyranny_and_labor">Media as Extensions of Tyranny and Labor</h3>
<p>This is an interesting thought that as the means of communication are improved, so are the means of tyranny</p>
<p>&quot;A speed-up in communications always enables a central authority to extend its operations to more distant margins&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 109&#41;</p>
<p>Clothing can be thought of as an extension as it concerns one&#39;s ability interact with the environment.</p>
<p>Light enables a whole new world or worlds and abolishes the notion of night and day.</p>
<p>&quot;Time is money,&quot; and money is the store of other people&#39;s time and effort&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 152&#41;</p>
<p>Money is the ultimate store of collective human endeavors and the translator of work from priest to prostitute.</p>
<p>&quot;Automation, which is electronic, does not represent physical work so much as programmed knowledge&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 154&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Although the medium is the message, the controls go beyond programming. The restraints are always directed to the &quot;content,&quot; which is always another medium. The content of the press is literary statement, as the content of the book is speech, and the content of the movie is the novel. So the effects of radio are quite independent of its programming&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 337&#41;</p>
<p>Money is not a closed system</p>
<h3 id="on_photography_and_travel">On Photography and Travel</h3>
<p>&quot;Time can be defeated, as it were, by reversal of its characteristics if only it be speeded up enough&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 170&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The age of Jung and Freud is, above all, the age of the photograph, the age of the full gamut of self-critical attitudes&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 218&#41;</p>
<p>I love this critique of photos and travel. Basically, as time goes on the value of those hobbies or objects dull our senses or sense of wonder.</p>
<p>&quot;contrived, prefabricated.&quot; He is not concerned to find out why the photograph has done this to us. But in the same way intelligent people in the past always deplored the way in which the book had become a substitute for inquiry, conversation, and reflection, and never troubled to reflect on the nature of the printed book. The book reader has always tended to be passive, because that is the best way to read. Today, the traveler has become passive&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 219&#41;</p>
<h3 id="how_media_changes_our_habits">How Media Changes Our Habits</h3>
<p>&quot;Difficulty of access does not confer adequacy of perception, though it may involve an object in an aura of pseudo-values, as with a gem, a movie star, or an old master&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 220&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;This now brings us to the factual core of the &quot;pseudoevent,&quot; a label applied to the new media, in general, because of their power to give new patterns to our lives by acceleration of older patterns&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 220&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;All media exist to invest our lives with artificial perception and arbitrary values&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 220&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The car has become the carapace, the protective and aggressive shell, of urban and suburban man&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 248&#41;</p>
<h3 id="ads_as_reflection_of_actual_society">Ads as Reflection of Actual Society</h3>
<p>&quot;Ads are news. What is wrong with them is that they are always good news&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 231&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The steady trend in advertising is to manifest the product as an integral part of large social purposes and processes. With very large budgets the commercial artists have tended to develop the ad into an icon, and icons are not specialist fragments or aspects but unified and compressed images of complex kind. They focus a large region of experience in tiny compass&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 250&#41;</p>
<p>He has a bullseye view of ads in my opinion - its how the milk ads can appear so important to society.</p>
<p>&quot;there are the new massive iconic ads with their compressed images that include producer and consumer, seller and society in a single image&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 251&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Ads seem to work on the very advanced principle that a small pellet or pattern in a noisy, redundant barrage of repetition will gradually assert itself. Ads push the principle of noise all the way to the plateau of persuasion. They are quite in accord with the procedures of brain-washing&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 251&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Ads are not meant for conscious consumption. They are intended as subliminal pills for the subconscious in order to exercise an hypnotic spell&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 252&#41;</p>
<h3 id="media_and_society">Media and Society</h3>
<p>&quot;Any community that wants to expedite and maximize the exchange of goods and services has simply got to homogenize its social life&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 253&#41;</p>
<p>This line makes me think of of Kuhn&#39;s idea of incommensurability.</p>
<p>&quot;our intensely individualist and fragmented Western world, &quot;booze&quot; is a social bond and a means of festive involvement. By contrast, in closely knit tribal society &quot;booze&quot; is destructive of all social pattern and is even used as a means to mystical experience&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 258&#41;</p>
<p>Interesting observation on the role of alcohol in communities.</p>
<p>&quot;Just as we now try to control atom-bomb fallout, so we will one day try to control media fallout. Education will become recognized as civil defense against media fallout&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 337&#41;</p>
<h3 id="comedy">Comedy</h3>
<p>&quot;We think of humor as a mark of sanity for a good reason: in fun and play we recover the integral person, who in the workaday world or in professional life can use only a small sector of his being&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 259&#41;</p>
<p>Beautiful commentary on comedy as a sort of lifeline to the self in a way.</p>
<h3 id="games_as_a_media">Games as a Media</h3>
<p>&quot;A game is a machine that can get into action only if the players consent to become puppets for a time&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 263&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps there is, just for this reason, a desperate need for games in a highly specialized industrial culture, since they are the only form of art accessible to many minds&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 266&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;A moral point of view too often serves as a substitute for understanding in technological matters. That games are extensions, not of our private but of our social selves, and that they are media of communication, should now be plain. If, finally, we ask, &quot;Are games mass media?&quot; the answer has to be &quot;Yes.&quot; Games are situations contrived to permit simultaneous participation of many people in some significant pattern of their own corporate lives.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 270&#41;</p>
<h3 id="media_and_the_nature_of_work">Media and the Nature of Work</h3>
<p>&quot;From this time on, the mere specialist in any field was doomed to the sterility and inanity that echoed an archaic form of the departing mechanical age&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 275&#41;</p>
<p>Really makes me think of Willy Loman from Death of a Salesman and my own grandfather.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, no new idea ever starts from within a big operation. It must assail the organization from outside, through some small but competing organization&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 277&#41;</p>
<p>This reminds me of the verse that says how no student can be above his teacher.</p>
<p>&quot;Northcote Parkinson&#39;s law that &quot;work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion&quot; is precisely the zany dynamic provided by the telephone&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 290&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;the main &quot;work to be done&quot; is actually the movement of information. The mere interrelating of people by selected information is now the principal source of wealth in the electric age&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 291&#41;</p>
<p>It is an interesting remark on labor saving devices. Rather than freeing up time, you end up doing more labor and work than before. It brought down the barrier of entry for menial tasks so all could do them.</p>
<p>&quot;A mechanized world is always in the process of getting ready to live, and to this end it brings to bear the most appalling pomp of skill and method and resourcefulness&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 321&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The world eagerly lined up to buy canned dreams&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 322&#41;</p>
<h3 id="the_nature_of_radio_as_a_media">The Nature of Radio as a Media</h3>
<p>&quot;To the blind, all things are unexpected&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 294&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The telephone: speech without walls. The phonograph: music hall without walls. The photograph: museum without walls. The electric light: space without walls&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 313&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;What the Orient saw in a Hollywood movie was a world in which all the ordinary people had cars and electric stoves and refrigerators. So the Oriental now regards himself as an ordinary person who has been deprived of the ordinary man&#39;s birthright&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 325&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;If a government monopolizes the radio, then by mere repetition and byRADIO 325 exclusion of conflicting points of view it can determine the opinions of the population&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 328&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;This is inherent in the very nature of this medium, with its power to turn the psyche and society into a single echo chamber&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 331&#41;</p>
<h3 id="televisions_idiosyncrasies_as_a_media">Television&#39;s Idiosyncrasies as a Media</h3>
<p>&quot;TV is a medium that rejects the sharp personality and favors the presentation of processes rather than of products&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 341&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;grammars of newspaper, or radio, or of film, but who look askew and askance at all non-book media. The simplest question about any psychic aspect, even of the book medium, throws these people into a panic of uncertainty. Vehemence of projection of a single isolated attitude they mistake for moral vigilance. Once these censors became aware that in all cases &quot;the medium is the message&quot; or the basic source of effects, they would turn to suppression of media as such, instead of seeking &quot;content&quot; control. Their current assumption that content or programming is the factor that influences outlook and action is derived from the book medium, with its sharp cleavage between form and content&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 347&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The failure of the sex-integration programs has provided the theme of much of the literature and psychoanalysis of the twentieth century. Race integration, undertaken on the basis of visual uniformity, is an extension of the same cultural strategy of literate man, for whom differences always seem to need eradication, both in sex and in race, and in space and in time&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 349&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Print gave intensity and uniform precision, where before there had been a diffuse texture. Print brought in the taste for exact measurement and repeatability that we now associate with science and mathematics&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 350&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The same new preference for depth participation has also prompted in the young a strong drive toward religious experience with rich liturgical overtones&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 354&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;anybody whose appearance strongly declares his role and status in life is wrong for TV Anybody who looks as if he might be a teacher, a doctor, a businessman, or any of a dozen other things all at the same time is right for TV&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 365&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The TV child expects involvement and doesn&#39;t want a specialist job in the future. He does want a role and a deep commitment to his society&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 370&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;The TV child cannot see ahead because he wants involvement, and he cannot accept a fragmentary and merely visualized goal or destiny in learning or in life&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 370&#41;</p>
<h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
<p>&quot;Since our new electric technology is not an extension of our bodies but of our central nervous systems, we now see all technology, including language, as a means of processing experience, a means of storing and speeding information. And in such a situation all technology can plausibly be regarded as weapons&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 379&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Dewart in his Crintanity adn Revolution, wehn he points tothe obsolescence fo the fragemnted balance of power techniques. As an instrument of policy, modern war has come to mean &quot;the existence and end of one society tot he esclusion of another&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 381&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Any subject taken in depth at once relates to other subjects. Arithmetic in grade three or nine, when taught in terms of number theory, symbolic logic, and cultural history, ceases to be mere practice in problems. Continued in their present patterns of fragmented unrelation, our school curricula will insure a citizenry unable to understand the cybernated world in which they live&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 383&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Men are suddenly nomadic gatherers of knowledge, nomadic as never before, informed as never before, free from fragmentary specialism as never before –but also involved in the total social process as never before; since with electricity we extend our central nervous system globally, instantly interrelating every human experience&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 395&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Tradition, in a word, is the sense of the total past as now&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 333&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody experiences far more than he understands&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 351&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;Before the huddle of the city, there was the food-gathering phase of man the hunter, even as men have now in the&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 378&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;electric age returned psychically and socially to the nomad state. Now, however, it is called information-gathering and data-processing&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 379&#41;</p>
<p>&quot;As Selye deals with the total environmental situation in his &quot;stress&quot; theory of disease, so the latest approach to media study considers not only the &quot;content&quot; but the medium and the cultural matrix within which the particular medium operates.&quot; &#40;McLuhan, 1994, p. 13&#41; How fascinating&#33; McLuhan knew of the stress theory of disease. I wonder how he knew that? I find it so fascinating the analogy McLuhan is making. It seems as though McLuhan proposes to say that the medium is an organ which interplay’s with Selye&#39;s theory. Rather than contradicting or separate from it, it subsists within and intertwined with this theory. In short, McLuhan seems to say that whereas Selye took an environmental approach to disease, McLuhan is taking a holistic view to mediums in a person&#39;s life</p>
<p>Selye&#39;s work preceded the work of Sir Michael Marmot in creating the Social Determinants of Health. Plus he was starting with the idea of metastatic load.</p>

<h3 id="on_the_non-linearity_of_science">On the Non-Linearity of Science</h3>
<p>One thing out of this book is that I very much appreciated and agreed with Kuhn&#39;s notion that science is not linear nor is it necessarily the result of a universal truth being uncovered. Rather, it is the confluence of emerging theories that evolve and find they can fit with other theories or paradigms. These newly combined theories then come together to possibly overturn or change the understanding of currently practiced science.</p>
<p>This fallacious notion of linear knowledge going to a particular truth about the world is based in part on science historians and textbook makers. As textbooks are designed to assist students in learning as much material as possible, the teacher with the textbook maker chooses to formulate a textbook around one particular area of knowledge thereby giving a sense of progress to a domain&#39;s particular truth. As science does not deal with all possible experiments but only those which are doable according to an existing paradigm, so too a textbook must be very judicious in what it presents to a student from its paradigm.</p>

<h3 id="invoking_new_paradigms_on_faith">Invoking New Paradigms on Faith</h3>
<p>A problem inherit to the development of new paradigms is that to adopt these new paradigms is most certainly an act of faith. Early adherents to a new paradigm must stand against the onslaught of problems that were solved or addressed by  a previous paradigm. They must simply have hope and faith that this new paradigm they have adopted will succeed in the areas where the previous paradigm failed. As Kuhn said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A decision of that kind can only be made on faith&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when this new paradigm is able to successfully surmount longstanding problems, Kuhn says that even still a vast majority of scientists will be apprehensive to adopt this paradigm. Why? Kuhn observed that two conditions must be met for further adoption:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The new paradigm must solve outstanding problems that the prior paradigm could not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Much of the problem solving tools from previous paradigms should still be able to be used in this new paradigm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this sense, there is a type of verification or vetting of a new paradigm – an analogy to natural selection as Kuhn pointed out. For a new paradigm to be successful, not only must it address all problems hitherto encountered by prior paradigms, but be able to solve outstanding problems prior paradigms could not and the barrier to adopting this new paradigm must be minimal. &quot;No theory ever solves all &#91;...&#93; puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect,&quot; is a fitting bookend from Kuhn to remember when encountering new paradigms.</p>
<p>One small final footnote on new paradigms is an observation by Kuhn: the invention of a paradigm most generally comes from someone very young or new to the field where a paradigm exists that they are trying to change.</p>

<h3 id="scientific_revolutions_and_the_term_revolution">&quot;Scientific Revolutions&quot; and the Term &quot;Revolution&quot;</h3>
<p>According to Kuhn, these crises are the requirements for a new paradigm to come forth. This leads to extraordinary science as this episode in a paradigm&#39;s life is extraordinary that causes a basic shift in how science is even conducted. This period, coined by Kuhn, is called a &quot;Scientific Revolution&quot;.</p>
<p>Kuhn was very particular in invoking the term &quot;revolution&quot;. He related the phrase &quot;scientific revolution&quot; analogously to a political revolution. In the same way that a political revolution is often fomented when a political body fails to serve adequately the growing body of its populace, so too are the grounds set for a scientific revolution.</p>
<p>Although a paradigm may shift how one does science, the world itself does not change. Rather, the way we view and operate in the world does. For the adoptees of a new paradigm, the adoptee must say something to the effect of &quot;I once understood X to be Y, but I was mistaken&quot; and in doing so admit a form of error in looking at reality.</p>

<h3 id="what_was_kuhns_concept_of_a_paradigm">What Was Kuhn&#39;s Concept of a Paradigm?</h3>
<p>Kuhn reintroduced into the modern English lexicon the word, &quot;paradigm&quot;. Before his time, the term was rather archaic. A paradigm is the background through which normal science is conducted loosely speaking. Another way of thinking about it is from Discord user <em>heynonnynonnie</em> suggesting that a paradigm is a consensus agreed upon by a group of practitioners of a field.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_characteristics_of_a_paradigm">What Are the Characteristics of a Paradigm?</h4>
<p>When he used the word, as Kuhn admitted himself, he overloaded the term to mean quite a number of things. To my understanding, this was my gist of a Kuhnian paradigm in that paradigms generally have two core characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Unprecedented and can sustain practitioners</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open-ended and with problems to be solved or investigated</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Endemic to paradigms is that they posit theories around a domain of research. For a paradigm to be accepted, it must propose a better theory than its predecessors or competitors. Furthermore, a proposed new paradigm is not required to address every fact of the world.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_benefits_of_choosing_a_paradigm">What Are the Benefits of Choosing a Paradigm?</h4>
<p>When a domain decides upon a paradigm, avenues of research can now be readily scoped. By presupposing paradigm, questions can now be posed within the context of the paradigm. In accordance to the paradigm, it can be reasonably assumed that solutions can be found.</p>
<p>A benefit that did not immediately appear to me was the insulating properties of a paradigm. An example that Kuhn suggested is that in the social sciences, one has to frame an avenue of research by its importance to society &#40;such as studying racial discrimination, etc.&#41;. Problems such as these are notoriously difficult to frame and reach a quorum consensus on due to possibly many competing schools of thought or groups. Instead, by keeping a conversation limited to the adherents of a specific paradigm, a researcher can easily keep moving forward through problems without having to strive against competing schools of thought. Furthermore, the insulating power of a paradigms gives a researcher the ability to solely focus on problems they think they can solve or are solvable.</p>
<p>I will admit, his example of social scientists was at first confusing. But, upon reflection, what made this example make sense is that he later explained his decision to have this as an example due to the fact that there are often many competing paradigms in these areas. This conflict makes progress difficult as many people still argue the fundamentals of these sciences.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This book has had an immense impact in the world of science. From how science is taught to how science is thought about, Kuhn&#39;s notions of scientific revolution resonated across nearly all domains of science as well as touching into the arts. The central conceit that Kuhn stated in this book is that the scientific community knows what the world is like. I was recommended this book by my friend, collaborator, and Category Theorist, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.jpfairbanks.com/">Professor James P. Fairbanks</a> I can see why it was recommended as it fits in quite nicely to the ensuing philosophical ideas found in <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11082021041951-category-theory-scientists.md">Category Theory</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_normal_science">What Is <em>Normal Science</em>?</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022044134-normal-science.md">Note for atomic concept</a></p>
<p>According to Kuhn, <em>normal science</em>, is research based on past scientific accomplishments that are considered the foundation for that area of investigation. Generally, this is the area where most scientists spend their time. The research done in normal science can be theoretical or empirical.</p>
<p>In the book, Kuhn referred to this as &quot;mop-up work&quot; and that this mopping up or &quot;filling out&quot; of science is what most scientists do. Although language such as &quot;mop-up&quot; work can make one think that Kuhn was being pejorative to these so-called &quot;scut scientists&quot;, he did not intend it so. In later versions of this book, he made a response to this point of confusion and clarified that this work still is fascinating and crucial in many ways to the advancement of science.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_characteristics_of_normal_science">What Are the Characteristics of Normal Science?</h4>
<p>An important aspect of normal science is that it does not engage with or seek out anything new. The invention of theories, development of new phenomena - anything abnormal - is not part of normal science. Novelty is abhorrent and antithetical to normal science.</p>
<p>Aside from this fundamental aspect of normal science, Kuhn posited that there are three general areas of research in normal science. He emphasized that they do not always hold or are always discrete from one another:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Investigating questions around the fundamental facts found in a specific domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Questions that are predicted and expected to have answers existing within an already existing research domain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Further articulating the fundamental facts held in a given domain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what_was_kuhns_concept_of_a_paradigm">What Was Kuhn&#39;s Concept of a Paradigm?</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022044626-kuhnian-paradigm.md">Note for atomic concept</a></p>
<p>Kuhn reintroduced into the modern English lexicon the word, &quot;paradigm&quot;. Before his time, the term was rather archaic. A paradigm is the background through which normal science is conducted loosely speaking. Another way of thinking about it is from online user <em>heynonnynonnie</em> suggesting that a paradigm is a consensus agreed upon by a group of practitioners of a field.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_characteristics_of_a_paradigm">What Are the Characteristics of a Paradigm?</h4>
<p>When he used the word, as Kuhn admitted himself, he overloaded the term to mean quite a number of things. To my understanding, this was my gist of a Kuhnian paradigm in that paradigms generally have two core characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Unprecedented and can sustain practitioners</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open-ended and with problems to be solved or investigated</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Endemic to paradigms is that they posit theories around a domain of research. For a paradigm to be accepted, it must propose a better theory than its predecessors or competitors. Furthermore, a proposed new paradigm is not required to address every fact of the world.</p>
<h4 id="what_are_the_benefits_of_choosing_a_paradigm">What Are the Benefits of Choosing a Paradigm?</h4>
<p>When a domain decides upon a paradigm, avenues of research can now be readily scoped. By presupposing paradigm, questions can now be posed within the context of the paradigm. In accordance to the paradigm, it can be reasonably assumed that solutions can be found.</p>
<p>A benefit that did not immediately appear to me was the insulating properties of a paradigm. An example that Kuhn suggested is that in the social sciences, one has to frame an avenue of research by its importance to society &#40;such as studying racial discrimination, etc.&#41;. Problems such as these are notoriously difficult to frame and reach a quorum consensus on due to possibly many competing schools of thought or groups.

But, upon reflection, what made this example make sense is that he later explained his decision to have this as an example due to the fact that there are often many competing paradigms in these areas. This conflict makes progress difficult as many people still argue the fundamentals of these sciences.</p>
<h3 id="what_causes_the_downfall_of_a_paradigm">What Causes the Downfall of a Paradigm?</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022044910-downfall-kuhnian-paradigm.md">Note on atomic concept</a></p>
<p>Normal science certainly is clear, safe, and predictable. But, what if a scientist finds results that do not fit within a paradigm? What if a result, ruling out all possible errors carried forth by a highly scrupulous researcher, is simply unexplainable - an anomaly against the backdrop of a paradigm? To Kuhn, this marks an important inflection point in adopted paradigms.</p>
<p>Novelty in science only emerges with resistance and difficulty because any, as Kuhn wisely points out, researchers who investigate every anomaly will not get much done. But at some point, these anomalies will continue to accumulate to the point of being unignorable to adherents of a paradigm. A sort of malcontent will arise adherents and to <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07222020181007-famous-quotes.md">quote Sherlock Holmes, &quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot;</a> And that truth is that an accepted paradigm is no longer sufficient to explain a domain which leads to a period of significant upheaval.</p>
<p>Kuhn characterized the downfall of a paradigm in three generic ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Awareness of anomaly</p>
</li>
<li><p>Further recognition of awareness</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contested possible change or challenge to the existing paradigm</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what_happens_when_a_paradigm_is_in_crisis">What Happens When a Paradigm Is in Crisis?</h4>
<p>When the anomalies are fully unconscionable, they are finally acknowledged and, to quote Kuhn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Discovery commences with &#91;...&#93; awareness of anomaly&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous paradigm prepared an adherent on how to detect an anomaly and in a way, set up its own downfall. At this stage of upheaval, many will attempt to explain or address the anomalous behavior. A new era of discovery in the face of a failing paradigm marks this interstitial period of an outdated paradigm where many speculative and unarticulated theories abound - often at odds with one another in some way. The previous paradigm&#39;s rules become hazy and the rules of normal research begin to veer away from its typical, standard process.</p>
<h4 id="extraordinary_problems">Extraordinary Problems</h4>
<p>This problem leads normal science into a rather interesting process of science called &quot;extraordinary science&quot;. Extraordinary science is an offshoot of normal science that exists when a paradigm is in crisis and to address the paradigm in crisis. It is the science that either repairs, questions, or proves the deficiency of an existing paradigm. Important to note about extraordinary science is that they are never known at the outset of a paradigm but only after advanced normal research in the context of a given paradigm.</p>
<h3 id="scientific_revolutions_and_the_term_revolution">&quot;Scientific Revolutions&quot; and the Term &quot;Revolution&quot;</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022045723-scientific-revolutions.md">Note on atomic concept</a></p>
<p>According to Kuhn, these crises are the requirements for a new paradigm to come forth. This leads to extraordinary science as this episode in a paradigm&#39;s life is extraordinary that causes a basic shift in how science is even conducted. This period, coined by Kuhn, is called a &quot;Scientific Revolution&quot;.</p>
<p>Kuhn was very particular in invoking the term &quot;revolution&quot;. He related the phrase &quot;scientific revolution&quot; analogously to a political revolution. In the same way that a political revolution is often fomented when a political body fails to serve adequately the growing body of its populace, so too are the grounds set for a scientific revolution.</p>
<p>Although a paradigm may shift how one does science, the world itself does not change. Rather, the way we view and operate in the world does. For the adoptees of a new paradigm, the adoptee must say something to the effect of &quot;I once understood X to be Y, but I was mistaken&quot; and in doing so admit a form of error in looking at reality.</p>
<h3 id="invoking_new_paradigms_on_faith">Invoking New Paradigms on Faith</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022045931-new-paradigms.md">Note on atomic concept</a></p>
<p>A problem inherit to the development of new paradigms is that to adopt these new paradigms is most certainly an act of faith. Early adherents to a new paradigm must stand against the onslaught of problems that were solved or addressed by  a previous paradigm. They must simply have hope and faith that this new paradigm they have adopted will succeed in the areas where the previous paradigm failed. As Kuhn said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A decision of that kind can only be made on faith&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when this new paradigm is able to successfully surmount longstanding problems, Kuhn says that even still a vast majority of scientists will be apprehensive to adopt this paradigm. Why? Kuhn observed that two conditions must be met for further adoption:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The new paradigm must solve outstanding problems that the prior paradigm could not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Much of the problem solving tools from previous paradigms should still be able to be used in this new paradigm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this sense, there is a type of verification or vetting of a new paradigm – an analogy to natural selection as Kuhn pointed out. For a new paradigm to be successful, not only must it address all problems hitherto encountered by prior paradigms, but be able to solve outstanding problems prior paradigms could not and the barrier to adopting this new paradigm must be minimal. &quot;No theory ever solves all &#91;...&#93; puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect,&quot; is a fitting bookend from Kuhn to remember when encountering new paradigms.</p>
<p>One small final footnote on new paradigms is an observation by Kuhn: the invention of a paradigm most generally comes from someone very young or new to the field where a paradigm exists that they are trying to change.</p>
<h3 id="on_the_non-linearity_of_science">On the Non-Linearity of Science</h3>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05222022050357-non-linearity-science.md">Note on atomic concept</a></p>
<p>One thing out of this book is that I very much appreciated and agreed with Kuhn&#39;s notion that science is not linear nor is it necessarily the result of a universal truth being uncovered. Rather, it is the confluence of emerging theories that evolve and find they can fit with other theories or paradigms. These newly combined theories then come together to possibly overturn or change the understanding of currently practiced science.</p>
<p>This fallacious notion of linear knowledge going to a particular truth about the world is based in part on science historians and textbook makers. As textbooks are designed to assist students in learning as much material as possible, the teacher with the textbook maker chooses to formulate a textbook around one particular area of knowledge thereby giving a sense of progress to a domain&#39;s particular truth. As science does not deal with all possible experiments but only those which are doable according to an existing paradigm, so too a textbook must be very judicious in what it presents to a student from its paradigm.</p>
<h3 id="additional_notes">Additional Notes</h3>
<p>As I wrap up this review of <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, here are some additional notes that didn&#39;t quite fit in the overall review. I did still find these pertinent as well as helpful in expanding thoughts about paradigms.</p>
<h4 id="paradigm_shifts_in_other_domains">Paradigm Shifts in Other Domains</h4>
<p>Outside of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, Kuhn&#39;s notion of paradigm shifts do occur. Such a paradigm shift based on Kuhn&#39;s writings in an area such as the social sciences could be - and I am making an educated guess here - something akin to the near modern universal condemnation and outlawing of slavery. However, to this end Kuhn posited that unlike the other natural sciences, there still exist competing schools of thought. A visceral modern example is that social scientists also have to defend their choice of a research problem such as examining race in the context of the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07112020161337-social-determinants-health.md">social determinants of health</a> where other existing schools of thought may fiercely disagree on the validity of such endeavors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kuhn gave the great example that, &quot;the man who argues that philosophy &#91;...&#93; has made no progress emphasizes that there are still Aristotelians, not that Aristotelianism has failed to progress,&quot; I am in agreement with Kuhn in that it is not that schools of thought outside Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics are not making progress. It is that their are much more fundamental conflicts in these spaces that have yet to be reconciled in sufficient ways.</p>
<p>In an online group discussion, the user <em>ish-i-ness</em> furthered this idea to the arts that, &quot;that in the arts you could even say that there is a desire to discover an aesthetic truth, something that is indisputably, objectively beautiful and thought provoking, rather than just a fad that is only interesting because it’s appeals to a particular, subjective set of preferences.&quot; Here, <em>ish-i-ness</em> invokes this notion of aesthetic truth which is associated with Theodore Adorno.</p>
<h4 id="non-kuhnian_revolutions_or_domain_transformations">Non-Kuhnian Revolutions or Domain Transformations</h4>
<p>In an online group discussion, the user <em>heynonnynonnie</em>, made a great point that non-Kuhnian scientific revolutions happen more frequently than the bigger Kuhnian scientific revolutions &#40;such as the heliocentric versus geocentric theory, etc.&#41;. As these are much smaller scale revolutions and do not affect the entirety of science, I call these &quot;domain transformations&quot; as they transform or affect a particular domain&#39;s way of operating but not the rest of science as a whole. <em>heynonnynonnie</em> gave the example that the discovery of the DNA structure, though fantastic and a major discovery, provided only pure information that fit within the preexisting paradigms.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I thought this book was well done and also worth this lengthy analysis. It provided context to a lot of ideas that were born from the notions Kuhn coined here. For me, it felt like giving me a bit more of a better foundation to understand better how to operate in domains. Even if this piece is labeled more as a philosophy of science piece, it could easily also be considered a sociological exploration of academia as a whole. I recommend the read, but also, not to take the notions as literally or seriously as possible. Kuhn himself suggested that as he later would get inundated with letters saying that there was a revolution happening because of X - help me. As judicious as Kuhn was in using the term revolution, we too must be careful to recognize when a revolution or paradigm shift is occurring.</p>

<p><em>A living note on my faith as a Christian</em></p>
<p>Saying you are a Christian is a loaded statement that colors a spectrum. It brings to mind the halls of a quiet countryside monastery echoing with billowing hymns to outraged shouts of damnation from a pulpit. Saying you are a Christian is strangely all encompassing and hollow simultaneously.</p>
<p>I am a Christian and this blog post is an overview of what <em>I</em> mean by that.</p>
<p>My faith as a Christian affects every aspect of my life as I view God as the Lord of All. I mean &quot;Lord of All&quot; as I view God is omniscient over what exists and what will be. He is the master programmer, the master engineer, the master author, the master – . And as a result of that, I view Him as the one source of knowledge and guidance.</p>
<p>I do not mean that one can learn everything from the Bible. There is no book in the Bible that contains Kepler&#39;s Laws of Planetary Motion or the Central Limit Theorem.  Rather, God communicates a framework through His Word, the Bible, that proves sufficient for every domain and has given us minds and bodies to go and explore His created world.</p>
<p>By God, it is my understanding that there are definite &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; absolutes set forth by a good and righteous God. A result of this I must address is the sad stereotype that unfortunately resonates all too frequently with the truth is the judgemental behavior found in Christian circles. This often has a cultural and historical aspect on how persons view religious institutions - I do not want to discuss that.</p>
<p>Instead, I endeavor practicing the ability to disagree with but accept others. Sadly, this is a skill that is all too-lacking - amongst Christians and beyond. I am perfectly fine discussing generally anything and perhaps most importantly, disagreeing over something. This is a pattern set forth by Jesus from the beginning. Jesus was not sent to those who agreed with him but those who so fiercely opposed Him that they killed Him and still showed compassion for his murderers.</p>
<p>And most important in my faith is my acceptance and trust in the person who is Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior of the World. Saving us from what? Ourselves. As I believe there are definite &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; absolutes, it would follow that there are consequences for when we pursue &quot;wrong&quot;. And out of those consequences, the most severe is separation from God both now while we are alive and the eternity that our souls find ourselves in upon our demise.</p>
<p>And Jesus is that saving power - that bridge which brings us from that separation to eternity with God. As no one has ever done what is &quot;right&quot; except only Jesus who was both God and a person just like us. I trust that Jesus was killed around 30 CE, He was entombed for three days, resurrected proving that death has no mastery over God, and ascended to the right hand of God. In short, when Jesus said to the grieving sister Martha over the death of her brother, Lazarus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">Jesus said to her,&quot;I am the resurrection and the life. 
The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; 
and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.Do you believe this?&quot;- John 11:25 - 26</code></pre>
<p>To which I respond: &quot;yes&quot;.  There are multiple omissions of my credo that I have left out here for brevity. I have further included a copy of the Nicaean Creed which I am in full accord with that can help fill in some of those gaps, succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nicaean Creed</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. </p>
<p>I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man.</p>
<p>For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets.</p>
<p>I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To leave off, please note: I am not a perfect Christian. No one is or can be. I try to follow God with confident steps; oftentimes, it looks more like a faltering walk. Yet, by the grace of God, I have courage that each day can be better and I can show Christ&#39;s love to others not through faux perfection of arrogance but the ordinary efforts of a common man with an extraordinary Savior.</p>

<p>An overview of how telehealth interventions could and should be deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Really excellent read in my opinion that goes beyond just the COVID-19 pandemic but rather can be taken and applied elsewhere in the telehealth landscape. In particular, their conclusions were interesting as well as their discussion on clinician unwillingness.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Telehealth is the remote delivery of healthcare via telecommunication tools &#91;3&#93; and the transferral of medical information between sites via telecommunications to improve patient health. &#91;4&#93; The term telehealth is often used interchangeably with the term &quot;telemedicine&quot; as well &#91;4&#93;, &#91;5&#93;</p>
<p>Given this definition, one of the most obvious goals of telehealth is to improve patient health and care. &#91;3&#93; Although this is the obvious and most idealistic goal for telehealth, there are other subtle goals of telehealth. For example, it may be to ease the burden to provider care or to assist with triage &#91;6&#93; or to enable cost savings for health systems or payers. &#91;7&#93;</p>

<h1>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> April 19 2022</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Book review on the extreme hedonism, classist privilege, and complete moral collapse written about Dorian Gray</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##summary #review #book #hedonism #privilege #corruption #morality #homosexuality #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>O. Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. OUP Oxford, 2006.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Introduction</li><li>Extreme Hedonism</li><li>Moral Collapse</li><li>On Homo-Eroticism</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This was a rather odd but enjoyable book. Even though Wilde more depicted this book as the evil and banality of hedonism taken to the extreme, it was a rather nice reminder, for me personally, that it is acceptable to enjoy life. To seek and find new experiences and adventures is perfectly fine, but as Wilde pointed out, there is a limit.</p>
<h3 id="extreme_hedonism">Extreme Hedonism</h3>
<p>What I really enjoyed was the characterizations of Dorian and Lord Henry as these somewhat egalitarians with Dorian being the more novice and Henry being the more advanced. Dorian somewhat starts as a perfect blank template - an Adonis ready to be made Henry&#39;s Pygmalion. With Henry&#39;s influence, Dorian starts to shed his &quot;classist good manners&quot; and evolve into a full hedonist to embrace the darker desires unknown to those belonging to &quot;Dorian&#39;s kind of society&quot;.</p>
<p>As Henry points out to Dorian,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which has a bit of truth to it. For sure we have all been tempted by that which we cannot have and perhaps we have given into a temptation. It certainly does give a bit of relief but then, we only want more. We are not bidden to ourselves to pursue that thing at all costs - if so, we would be no different than mere animals chasing every desire. Yet, that is exactly what Dorian believes after Henry explains his ideas to him.</p>
<h3 id="moral_collapse">Moral Collapse</h3>
<p>This begins to manifest in Dorian believing in his inherent superiority due to his charm and good looks that Henry and Basil praises him for. That perspective can be encapsulated in Basil saying, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.  They can sit quietly and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live, undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Basil meant this more as a social commentary and not entirely a classist judgement, Henry followed up later with a similar but different sentiment of this same notion. Here, Henry instead says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Society, civilized society at least, is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and charming&#91;.&#93;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, Henry&#39;s view is more of the kind saying, &quot;hey, you have more privilege and power than you think. Use it.&quot; In this case, he encourages the use of this privilege and power at the expense of all others. In Basil&#39;s comment, he more encourages Dorian to recognize his privilege and power but to be a wise steward of it. Instead, Dorian follows Henry&#39;s influence to gratify all of himself.</p>
<p>Before Dorian fully sheds his soul, after the suicide of Sibyl caused nearly directly by Dorian, there is a moment of tragic reflective introspection Dorian has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&#91;W&#93;hy is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says as he nearly begs Henry for an answer. Rather than this being a true moment for introspection, Henry instead just encourages Dorian to brush this off as an experience. Perhaps not the most happy of experience, but one nonetheless. Although Dorian knows he out to feel something, he instead allows Henry to salve his wounds.</p>
<p>In so doing, &quot;the life that was to make his soul,&quot; was avoided and any &quot;&#91;marring of&#93; his body&quot;, Dorian was spared. This enabled him to commit even worse terrors. The murder of Basil, the blackmailing of Alan, and the ruin of many of those around him, Dorian was now fully unchained to pursue it all. Dorian&#39;s moral collapse was well and truly complete.</p>
<h3 id="on_homo-eroticism">On Homo-Eroticism</h3>
<p>There was a strong undercurrent of homosexuality and homo-eroticism in this book. With Basil&#39;s unreuited love for Dorian, the homosexuality here was shown rather positively. Yet, with Dorian, this was portrayed as predatory to men and youth around him. A welcome change of the oft-condemning of homosexuals in Victorian literature but rather a sort of early value judgement on what was moral and immoral homosexual behavior for that time. Most likely this was a direct commentary from Wilde himself as a bisexual person but it wove into the narrative rather well.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Knowledge is one of the most nebulous ideas known to mankind since nearly the beginning of time. What may be knowledge to one person may be useless noise to another - this encapsulates the difficulty in defining knowledge. As a result of its many possible meanings, I put forth a rather opinionated proposal for what I term the &quot;Open Knowledge Model&quot;.</p>
<p>The Open Knowledge Model is a standard that defines not how to maintain knowledge in what are typically coined &quot;knowledge management systems&quot;. Instead, its focus is on how to structure information that goes directly into such systems. It is fully compatible with the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.iso.org/standard/68683.html">ISO 30401</a> standard.</p>
<p>There are many different knowledge management systems available to someone – from a pen and pencil to various software offerings. Each of these offerings are very unique and accordingly offer benefits and cons. This model remains independent of any such offering but instead prescribes a model to structure information in any of the offerings one chooses to pursue.</p>
<h3 id="model_components">Model Components</h3>
<p>The model is composed of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Title Block</strong> - this is a unique block that begins with the name of the note followed by three required subcomponents:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- **Date** - the date the note was created
- **Summary** - a brief, single sentence summary of what this note is about
- **Keywords** - keywords that can be used to find or associated with the content of this note</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bibliography Block</strong> - this contains the bibliographic information that is associated with the specific note</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Notes</strong> - where one&#39;s notes go on the note subject in whatever format one so chooses</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>References</strong> - list of references used in the note</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is the core requirement of the model.  What follows are a few digressions on this model. </p>
<h3 id="digressions_and_recommendations_for_model">Digressions and Recommendations for Model</h3>
<h4 id="title_block">Title Block</h4>
<p>It is recommended that for <strong>Date</strong>, one chooses a consistent convention for how one will record the date across their knowledge base using this model.  In practice, there can be as many <strong>Keywords</strong> as one chooses, but it is often better to be more concise in what you choose as words.</p>
<h4 id="bibliography_block">Bibliography Block</h4>
<p>It can be possible that there isn&#39;t one bibliography associated with this not or none at all.  In those situations, it makes sense to perhaps write something like: &quot;Not Available&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>This is the most critical piece to any note.  One can structure and write their notes in any way they please here.  Include images, diagrams, code snippets – anything your knowledge management system supports. The model imposes no specific structure here – implementations may differ.</p>
<h4 id="references">References</h4>
<p>It is recommended to never write down the references section manually. Instead, offload this to a third party reference manager or another tool that could generate this information from a given note. </p>
<h3 id="implementation_examples">Implementation Examples</h3>
<p>To give an example of implementations, here are some examples of implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08032021134232-notes-template.md">Markdown Implementation</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tools_for_working_with_model">Tools for Working with Model</h3>
<p>Here are a list of some tools that have emerged to work with the Open Knowledge Model: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://github.com/TheCedarPrince/NoteMate">NoteMate.jl</a> - a companion for working with a knowledge management system that adheres to the Open Knowledge Model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Written in Julia and offers parsing from Markdown notes to other target formats.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This standard is an active work in progress and is the product of years of experimentation.  If you find problems with this model or believe it too restrictive or unwise, please comment in the discussion or reach out to me. My hope is that this standard will co-evolve with new tools and increase the utility of any person&#39;s knowledge management system.</p>

<p>One such sharply divisive word is the verb &quot;mansplain,&quot; coined by Rebecca Solnit</p>
<p>Mansplaining is not just when a man explains something to a woman in a patronizing way. It is when they do it despite there being clear signs that the woman already knows it and possibly knows it better than they do, which fits into a pattern that many women experience across their whole lives, of society generally assuming that men are more knowledgeable than women</p>

<p>One contentious example is body mass index, or BMI. The formula for BMI uses height and weight, so the relationship between height, weight, and BMI is defined and fixed. However, BMI is then taken as a proxy for body fat, which is then in turn taken as a proxy for healthiness, even though those relationships are not fixed or precisely definable</p>

<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>E. Cheng, X &#43; Y: A Mathematician’s Manifesto for Rethinking Gender. Basic Books, 2020.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Introduction</li><li>Category Theory as Tool for Thinking on Gender</li><li>Congressive versus Ingressive Thinking</li><li>Conclusion</li><li>Final Thoughts</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Eugenia Cheng takes a nuanced approach to the discussion around gender. As she references, some feminists&#39; battle cry is the phrase, &quot;Smash the patriarchy&#33;&quot;. In Cheng&#39;s idea of feminism, she instead looks for language that is less divisive and more inclusive encompassed in her saying, &quot;Let’s transform our world into a more congressively led future.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="category_theory_as_tool_for_thinking_on_gender">Category Theory as Tool for Thinking on Gender</h3>
<p>With this approach, she launches into her core contribution to the discussion on gender which is introducing the mathematics of <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11082021041951-category-theory-scientists.md">category theory</a> to decouple historical characteristics associated genders from the genders themselves. Cheng argues that this is a better approach to take in gender discussions to think more deeply about traits or characteristics in isolation rather than rooted in gender. You can then critique a characteristic or trait rather than a whole group of people.</p>
<p>Rather than being a book on mathematics and gender, category theory is used more as a mental model or framework to enact this decoupling. This works well as category theory fundamentally concerns itself about relationships. In her opinion, category theory enables one to think more clearly about about characteristics with a great degree of flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="congressive_versus_ingressive_thinking">Congressive versus Ingressive Thinking</h3>
<p>Cheng introduced two crucial words into her argument which can describe concepts, behaviors or people: &quot;congressive&quot; and &quot;ingressive&quot;. This is how she defined these terms summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ingressive</strong> - putting oneself over society, imposing on others frequently, far more individualistic than collaborative, less flexible thinking</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Congressive</strong> - society over self, prioritizing others, highly collective and community-focused, holistic thought patterns</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the onus of characteristics is moved from tightly coupled gender stereotypes to decoupled conversations on those characteristics in isolation. However, this isn&#39;t entirely the case all the time as most concepts, behaviors, or people have some tendencies to ingressive behavior and some to congressive behavior. As Cheng herself posits, &quot;When gender is relevant, we need to consider it. When character is relevant, we need to consider it.  But we shouldn&#39;t assume they are linked.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>She concludes in her book how she doesn&#39;t want, &quot;to see &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; character traits evaluated against each other &#91;...&#93; so only one side can win,&quot; in discussions around gender. She emphasizes how she doesn&#39;t want women having to act like men to succeed. Rather, she believes that there are not only other ways to make contributions to society but rather that there are other traditional forms of success.</p>
<h3 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this book&#33; I feel like her point was made pretty early on and I appreciated some of the examples. However, as I am acquainted with category theory as well as having read some material on gender studies in the past, I personally was able to skip through various parts.</p>
<p>I think her notion of decoupling is immensely important however I am not sure on her terminology of &quot;ingressive&quot; and &quot;congressive&quot;. Whenever anyone overloads terms with additional definitions, it makes me nervous that confusion in discussion can occur. However, since these are not commonly used terms, at least in my experience, it makes me think this may not be as big an issue.</p>
<p>Finally, it has made me think about where this method of decoupling can be used rigorously. In particular, I am curious about race and concepts such as the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07112020161337-social-determinants-health.md">social determinants of health</a> and how category theoretic approaches can be brought there. I think Cheng even teases readers with this idea so I am curious to see if she revisits the ideas someday:</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of a temporary abstraction also takes into account the thorny issue of intersectionality, and the need to take other forms of power imbalance into account besides those governed by gender, for example race, wealth, sexual orientation, and so on.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall, good read&#33;</p>

<p>Denied claims are medical claims that an insurer determined they did not need to pay after processing. The denial can be for many reasons ranging from clerical errors in the coding or submission process to breaches of the patient-payer contract. These denied claims are sent back to the biller with an Explanation of Benefits or Electronic Remittance Advice which both explain why the claim was denied and how to potentially appeal the denial. &#91;1&#93;</p>

<h1>Lord of the Flies</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> April 10 2022</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A review of the book as well as thoughts on why I did not enjoy it</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##summary ##book #survival #social #critique #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>W. Golding, Lord of the flies: Casebook edition. Penguin, 1987.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>I did not enjoy this book much at all. When I had finished reading it, I was left thinking to myself, &quot;that was it? This is the book so many put on a pedestal?&quot; I very much expected more for a supposed critique on the banality of man. Instead, it read a very contrived scenario that just did not feel much like life. To explain my thoughts, here are some of my findings about the book after researching the author:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It has been well documented that the author used his students in experiments to test human behavior.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These experiments were very contrived and did were very haphazardly done &#91;1&#93;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>This book was written as a parody of a different book called Coral Island where kids were lost on an island and made a utopia.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The author wrote this as if to say this is what really happens with kids on an island.&#91;1&#93;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>The book is highly idiosyncratic to British life and schooling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just these three points made me think the book was awful. As the book was written to talk about how children, left to their own devices, would create society and destroy it,it is oddly moralistic. You are put in a position to watch the unfurling of this horrific story take place from an objective standpoint. But based on point one, you are not all that objective.</p>
<p>Point two I feel is not talked about a lot but should be more. If this book is just parody then why is it treated as novel and even realistic at all? Coral Island was contrived just as Lord of the Flies is now,just in the opposite direction. Whether man falls to utopia or dystopia is not a binary choice but a sliding scale of morality That is very dependent on many factors.</p>
<p>Also it should not be forgotten that this book is a critique on British schooling as well. That context alone should remind that this book does not parody much of life at all but a very small cross section of it. How much can be taken from British life to other modes of living is most likely minimal.</p>

<h1>Othello</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> April 9 2022</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A review of the book Othello and some thoughts on the central conflict</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##summary ##book #play #tragedy #racism #boredeom ##blog #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>W. Shakespeare and others, &quot;Othello:&#91;1622&#93;,&quot; Oxford Text Archive Core Collection, 1991.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Racism and Deconstruction of the Noble Savage</li><li>Manipulation as Enigmatic Entertainment</li><li>Transcendental Love</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="racism_and_deconstruction_of_the_noble_savage">Racism and Deconstruction of the Noble Savage</h3>
<p>It is surprisingly progressive in some ways I found - even by today&#39;s standards which was interesting. The racist overtones in the book were very much in your face but with the treatment of Othello, I did not find it similar to the idea of the &quot;noble savage&quot; literary idea but rather much different. Instead, it felt like Othello was treated by all other accounts either an equal or due to his experience, exempt from the racial overtures his peers had towards him generally.</p>
<h3 id="manipulation_as_enigmatic_entertainment">Manipulation as Enigmatic Entertainment</h3>
<p>What I enjoyed the most was this could be also retitled: &quot;Gaslighting: the Book&quot; with how the villain Iago manipulated everyone in the book. It was breathtaking the amount of animus Iago had to everyone and what stuck with me the most at the end when the character was finally caught in his schemes was that Iago didn&#39;t really have a reason. Even when Iago himself was trying to justify himself, it was very shaky at best and he knew it. I think he was just a character who knew he could be good at being very bad and enjoyed the power trip it gave him.</p>
<p>I quite liked the fact that he did not have a real motive. It drove home the pettiness of him but is not unrealistic. To me, he reminded me of a man who was very bored and his most fun was in controlling the lives of others in some way even if it meant his ruin. It has been said that the most dangerous people to watch for are those who have nothing to lose when you have every thing to lose. The think this is a very apt description of Iago as a man who has nothing but is happy to see some one lose everything.</p>
<h3 id="transcendental_love">Transcendental Love</h3>
<p>Finally, what has stuck with me is how much Othello and Desdemona were in love with each other. It was typical of Shakespeare to write these deep romances where the bonds between the lovers could transcend the times that the people were from. It is both saddening and interesting that the situation described here is not too dissimilar to the world we live in still. In the start of the book, you can see the bigotry at full display in the father of Desdemona which is eerily like modern discussions.</p>

<p>The Resource Description Framework &#40;RDF&#41; is a family of specifications created by the World Wide Web Consortium &#40;W3C&#41; and formally adopted by W3C in 1999. The RDF specification was originally created by the as a data model for managing and storing metadata found on the internet. In recent years, it has become a general framework for web resource tooling and provides an abstract model that can be used in multiple serialization formats.</p>

<p>There are many different file storage formats for RDF reified data.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_the_turtle_format">What Is the Turtle Format?</h3>
<p>The Turtle format &#40;file extension <code>.ttl</code>&#41; is one example of a storage format. It takes the following form:</p>

<h4 id="what_is_an_example_of_the_turtle_format">What Is an Example of the Turtle Format?</h4>
<p>If I have the statement:</p>

<p>That can be written in the form:</p>

<h3 id="what_is_the_xml_format">What Is the XML Format?</h3>
<p>Another example is utilizing the popular XML format for representing RDF data.</p>

<p>RDFs can be also formulated as ACSets. To show how this is possible, let&#39;s walk through an example on how this happens:</p>
<p>The RDF triples &quot;The sky is colored blue.&quot;, &quot;Grass is colored green.&quot;, and &quot;The ocean is colored blue&quot; can all be represented as a Directed Multigraph \(G\).</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LRsky --is colored--&gt; blue
ocean --is colored--&gt; blue
grass --is colored--&gt; green</code></pre>
\[
G
\]
<p>can be thought of as an instance implementation of an ACSet representation of the RDF format. The ACSet schema defined for this family of RDFs can be defined at a higher level abstraction as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">Thing --is colored--&gt; Color</code></pre>
<p><em>Thing</em> represents a generalized Subject Object, <em>Color</em> represents a generalized Resource Object, and <em>is colored</em> defines the Predicate morphism for this Category of RDFs.</p>

<p>The Resource Description Framework &#40;RDF&#41; is a family of specifications created by the World Wide Web Consortium &#40;W3C&#41; and formally adopted by W3C in 1999. Data mapped into the RDF form into triplets called <em>RDF statements</em> &#40;also known as Semantic Triplets&#41;.</p>
<h3 id="what_are_rdf_triplets">What Are RDF Triplets?</h3>
<p>These triplets, or statements, are comprised of three components called the <em>subject</em>, the <em>predicate</em>, and the <em>object</em>. In summary, these components are described as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Subject</strong> - this denotes a resource where anything can be a resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is synonymous with the idea of an entity in other data models.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Predicate</strong> - traits or aspects of a defined resource and expresses the relationship between a <strong>Subject</strong> or a given <strong>Object</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Object</strong> - the target of the predicate and is similar to a resource in that anything can be an <strong>Object</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What the RDF statement compactly communicates is that there holds some relationship, indicated by the predicate, between the <strong>Subject</strong> and <strong>Object</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what_are_examples_of_rdf_triplets">What Are Examples of RDF Triplets?</h3>
<p>Example RDF statements are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The sky is colored blue.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking the statement &quot;The sky is colored blue.&quot; the <strong>Subject</strong> is the phrase &quot;sky&quot;, the <strong>Predicate</strong> is the verb phrase &quot;is colored&quot;, and the <strong>Object</strong> is the final phrase, &quot;blue&quot;. Moving forward from this example, it may be useful to think of the RDF statement as a labeled directed multigraph where components of the statement are typically broken down and stored in Relational Database Management Systems or native RDF file storage formats. Here is a way of visualizing the triplet for the given statements above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LRsky --is colored--&gt; blue
ocean --is colored--&gt; blue
grass --is colored--&gt; green</code></pre>
<p>The RDF triples &quot;The sky is colored blue.&quot;, &quot;Grass is colored green.&quot;, and &quot;The ocean is colored blue&quot; can all be represented as a Directed Multigraph \(G\). The nodes \(sky\), \(ocean\), and \(grass\) are <strong>Subjects</strong>, the nodes \(blue\) and \(green\) are <strong>Objects</strong>, and the edge \(is colored\) is the <strong>Predicate</strong> in these RDF triple.</p>

<p>In general, there are <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12092021203839-types-claims.md">several different types of claims</a>.</p>
<p>The following diagram depicts how data is generated and passed through a medical billing process:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">flowchart TBn1&#91;Medical Staff&#93; --&gt; n2&#91;Medical Services&#93;;
n3&#91;Patients&#93; --&gt; n2;
n2 --&gt; n4&#91;Medical Coders&#93;;

style n3 fill:#006400
style n6 fill:#8b0000</code></pre>
<p>Here, the green blocks representing medical staff and patients, denote where data originates from. Whenever a medical staffer provides or a patient seeks a medical service, data is generated &#40;these encounters could be routine health check-ups, emergency room visits, or anything involving an interaction with a medical service provider&#41;. These services are then recorded and passed along to medical coders whose job it is to match a service provided with a correct standardized medical code &#40;standards include coding such as ICD-10, HCPCS, etc&#41;. After these services are matched to a correct standard, the coded services are then passed on to a medical biller who determines what is covered by a patient&#39;s insurance and what is not. Depending on what is or is not covered, this claims data then passes to insurance providers in a back and forth process to adequately pay for the services utilized by the patient and patients may also be directly be billed for services leading to potentially either return visits or these claims to be appealed by the patient.</p>

<p>The definition of pure is somewhat of a moving target. Pure can mean many things and when applied to programming functions - even more so. Based on querying the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://discourse.julialang.org/t/can-programming-in-julia-be-pure/71165">Julia community</a>, here was what I understood pure functions to be.</p>
<p>Based on Milewski&#39;s definition, &quot;A pure function is one in which the same result is always produced with no side effects given the same input.&quot; &#91;1&#93; <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://github.com/CameronBieganek">Cameron Bieganek</a> explained how, in Julia specifically, you can write functions that are &quot;probably&quot; pure. However, there is no real guarantee that a function is actually pure, because it depends on the various methods that have been implemented. I like the notion of &quot;probably&quot; pure as it encapsulates a more pragmatic approach to the internals of a given language. It lets one get away without having to necessarily be completely aware of all the internals when discussing purity.</p>
<p>Finally, pure functions are different from mathematical functions for the reason that mathematical functions map a value to another value. Pure functions written in a programming language involve more than just a mapping. &#91;1&#93;</p>

<p>All functions are <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11082021225843-pure-functions.md">pure</a> within Haskell. This means that the same result is always produced with no side effects given the same input to a Haskell function.</p>
<h4 id="ar">Ar</h4>
<h3 id="haskell_type_system">Haskell Type System</h3>
<p>Except only in very seldom cases, type annotations are optional in Haskell.</p>

<p>A two element set of <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.</p>
<h4 id="char"><code>Char</code></h4>
<p>A set of all Unicode characters.</p>
<h4 id="string"><code>String</code></h4>
<p>A synonym for an infinite list of <code>Char</code>&#39;s.</p>
<h4 id="8979721170172830534"><code>&#40;&#41;</code></h4>
<p>A dummy value where there is only one instance of it ever. It is pronounced unit.</p>

<h4 id="type_coercion">Type Coercion</h4>
<p>Haskell provides <code>unsafeCoerce</code> to bypass the type system.</p>
<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>
<h4 id="types">Types</h4>
<p>All concrete types start with a capital letter. Names of type variables start with a lowercase letter.</p>
<h4 id="functions__2">Functions</h4>
<p>A function type is created by putting an arrow between two types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">f :: foo -&gt; bar</code></pre>
<p>A function definition uses the name of the function and formal parameters. The body of a function follows an equals sign. Furthermore, the body of a function is always an expression.</p>
<p>One of the strangest quirks about Haskell functions is that arguments are neither surrounded by parentheses nor separated by commas.</p>

<h4 id="function_composition">Function Composition</h4>
<p>Functions can be composed by putting a period between them &#40;or a Unicode circle, &quot;◦&quot;&#41;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">-- Define two functions:

<pre><code class="language-haskell">f :: foo -&gt; bar</code></pre>
<h4 id="infix_operators">Infix Operators</h4>
<p>Any infix operator can be turned into a two-argument function by surrounding them with parentheses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">&quot;Hello &quot; &#43;&#43; &quot;world&#33;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Can be rewritten as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">&#40;&#43;&#43;&#41; &quot;Hello &quot; &quot;world&#33;&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="equality">Equality</h3>
<h4 id="functional_equality">Functional Equality</h4>
<p>Haskell enables you to express equality of functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">mappend &#61; &#40;&#43;&#43;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>This is also known as point-free equality as the arguments to these functions are not defined.</p>
<h4 id="extensional_equality">Extensional Equality</h4>
<p>Haskell defines extensional equality loosely where</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">mappend s1 s2 &#61; &#40;&#43;&#43;&#41; s1 s2</code></pre>
<p>is saying that the output of the function of the left is equivalent to the output of the function on the right. This is also known as point-wise equality as the arguments &#40;points&#41; are defined.</p>

<h3 id="paradigm">Paradigm</h3>
<p>The approach of asking programming questions that functional programmers take is much more overarching. &#91;1&#93; Examples are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When designing an interactive program, they would ask: What is interaction?</p>
</li>
<li><p>When implementing Conway&#39;s Game of Life, they would ruminate on the meaning of life.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To a functional programmer, the essence of programming, per Milewski, is to take big problems and decompose them into smaller problems. Then create small solutions that can then be composed together to solve the big problem. &#91;1&#93;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sometimes the job of a data scientist is to know when you don&#39;t know enough.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="general_observations">General Observations</h3>
<p>According to O&#39;neil, profits have often come about to provide a stand-in as a value judgement on what is right or true. To that end, we are often vetted by algorithmically based on who we are &#40;e.g. our backgrounds, race, etc.&#41; and not on how we actually perform or fare.</p>
<p>Model construction happens from:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>not just from data but from the choices we make about which data to pay attention to—and which to leave out.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those choices are not just about logistics, profits, and efficiency. They are fundamentally moral. We have to learn to interrogate our data collection process, not just our algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="credit_scores_as_a_proxy_for_human_value">Credit Scores as a Proxy for Human Value</h3>
<p>When considering credit scores, money or wealth is no longer just about a means of survival. Wrapped up in these scores is also a value judgement on someone&#39;s self-worth. </p>
<p>Algorithms prioritize two factors: efficiency and profit. They do not care about justice or the well-being of the people underlying the data they are analyzing.</p>
<h3 id="concluding_thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h3>
<p>So the first step is to get a grip on our techno-utopia, that unbounded and unwarranted hope in what algorithms and technology can accomplish. Before asking them to do better, we have to admit they can’t do everything</p>
<p>audits have to be carefully designed and tested by human beings, and afterward automated</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Real-World Evidence, according to Congress, is any data that concerns the use, benefits, or risks of a drug from nontraditional sources &#40;i.e. clinical trials&#41;</p>
<h3 id="united_states_food_and_drug_administration_definitions">United States Food and Drug Administration Definitions</h3>
<p>The United States Food and Drug Administration found this definition from Congress to be too expansive and vague. For their purposes, they limited the language further to make the definitions less vague. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Real-world data</strong> &quot;relates to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Electronic health records
- Claims and billing activities
- Product and disease registries 
- Patient-generated data including in home-use settings 
- Mobile device data</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Real-world evidence</strong> is &quot;clinical evidence regarding the usage and potential benefits or risks of a medical product derived from analysis of real-world evidence.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Randomized trials 
	- Large simple trials
	- Pragmatic trials
	- Observational studies &#40;prospective and/or retrospective&#41;.</code></pre>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A note that provides an overview to intensive care unit scoring systems</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##overview #intensive #care #unit #rating #scoring #prediction #quality #care #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>A. Rapsang and D. C. Shyam, &quot;Scoring systems in the intensive care unit: A compendium,&quot; Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine, vol. 18, no. 4, pp. 220–228, Apr. 2014, doi: 10.4103/0972-5229.130573.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>What is a Scoring System?</li><li>What Characterizes a Scoring System?</li><li>What Are Characteristics of an Ideal Model?</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>This paper was useful as it provided a good overview of intensive care unit scoring systems. It enumerated their characteristics and also talked about their advantages. The paper also went over a variety of scoring systems but as I was concerned with learning what scoring systems in general were, I stopped there.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_a_scoring_system">What is a Scoring System?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is one approach clinical staff in an intensive care unit utilize to predict patient outcomes <em>and</em> to improve clinical decisions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, intensive care unit scoring systems&#33;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is an intensive care unit scoring system?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These scoring systems &#40;also referred to as severity scales&#41; are calculated alongside traditional diagnosis methods. They are used to: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Predict patient outcomes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compare quality of care</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create breakdowns for clinical trials</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They are handy for also analyzing unexpected patient outcomes and what precipitated the outcome.</p>
<h3 id="what_characterizes_a_scoring_system">What Characterizes a Scoring System?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a scoring system comprised of?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A scoring system generally has two components:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Score - a number assigned to a given disease based on severity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Probability Model - determines the probability of patient deaths.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>How are scoring system probability models used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, a model gives clinical decision makers additional insight into comparing patient populations for:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Treatment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Triage</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comparative analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Understanding treatment effectiveness</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimizing resources</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what_are_characteristics_of_an_ideal_model">What Are Characteristics of an Ideal Model?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the three characteristics of an ideal model for scoring?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ideal model must be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Valid</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calibrated</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discriminated</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean for a model to have &quot;validity&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Validity&quot; means how well a model performs on test datasets during the model&#39;s creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does a &quot;calibrated&quot; model mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accuracy between estimated mortality probabilities and the actual mortalities experienced by patients. What is key to note is that it is also able to be statistically robust/rigorous. &#91;1&#93; Essentially, is the model well suited to the actual patients being evaluated?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does a model that is &quot;discriminatory&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How well the model can determine what patients live and what patients die in practice. Examples of measures used to understand discriminatory patterns in a model are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sensitivity</p>
</li>
<li><p>Specificity</p>
</li>
<li><p>False positive rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>False negative rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Positive predictive power</p>
</li>
<li><p>Misclassification rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concordance. &#91;2&#93;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 9 2021</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> An overview on my current thinking about equity and those who</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> #advantage #disadvantage #equity ##thought #race #class #archive</p>

<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Thoughts on the Emerging Disadvantaged Trends in US Caucasian Populations</li><li>The Intersections of Advantaged and Disadvantaged</li><li>An Emerging Tension</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References:</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>This concerns my evolving thoughts concerning those who move from a state of historical advantage to one of disadvantage. The language of advantage to disadvantage comes from a Dr. Sylvie &#91;XXX&#93; who described this notion first at the &#91;2021 NAHDO Conference&#93;. &lt;&#33;–Find Dr. Sylvie&#39;s last name–&gt;</p>
<h3 id="thoughts_on_the_emerging_disadvantaged_trends_in_us_caucasian_populations">Thoughts on the Emerging Disadvantaged Trends in US Caucasian Populations</h3>
<p>Of particular note, there has been the emergence of a sub-class of persons in the United States amongst the low-income communities. Unlike historically marginalized people groups, such as African Americans, Asian American and Pacific Islanders, or Latin Americans, this particular sub-class exists at the intersection of traditional disadvantage and historical advantage: Caucasian. How can a class of such long-standing advantage find itself disadvantaged is the very question I have been thinking about.</p>
<h3 id="the_intersections_of_advantaged_and_disadvantaged">The Intersections of Advantaged and Disadvantaged</h3>
<p>I recall from a talk from the MIT Health Equity Conference that a Dr. &#91;XXX&#93; said the phrase, &quot;Race is not monolithic.&quot; &lt;&#33;–Find reference to MIT talk and Dr&#39;s name–&gt; That statement I think could also be extended to class structure as the aphorism, &quot;Class is not monolithic.&quot; In popular discussion, the conversation about disadvantaged populations generally have focused particularly at the intersection of disadvantage-disadvantage with respect to race and class. Yet, the intersection of advantage-disadvantage produces an uncomfortable problem: how should we handle these populations?</p>
<p>This intersectional breakdown could be summarized loosely as follows:</p>
<table><tr><th align="right">Type</th><th align="right">Race</th><th align="right">Class</th><th align="right">Examples</th></tr><tr><td align="right">Historically advantaged</td><td align="right">Advantaged</td><td align="right">Advantaged</td><td align="right">Victorian aristocracy, robber barons</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Emerging advantaged</td><td align="right">Disadvantaged</td><td align="right">Advantaged</td><td align="right">Textile traders, public servants</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Transitional disadvantaged</td><td align="right">Advantaged</td><td align="right">Disadvantaged</td><td align="right">Coal miners, share croppers</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Apparent disadvantaged</td><td align="right">Disadvantaged</td><td align="right">Disadvantaged</td><td align="right">Slaves, serfs</td></tr></table>

<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>Arrays are: 	- Statically allocated &#40;they are stored in memory and do not change; values can tho&#41; 	- Contiguous blocks of memory &#40;meaning that they are stored end to end in memory&#41;</p>
<p>They provide <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/09242021040445-asymptotic-notation.md">constant complexity</a> of \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) when accessing data at a specific index in memory.</p>
<p>They are of particular use in storing sequences of related items. However, they are not very efficient when dealing with dynamically changing sizes for elements. If you try to fit \(10\) objects into an array of size \(5\), the array will need to be expanded.</p>

- Basic arithmetic
	- Addition
	- Subtraction
	- Multiplication
	- Division
	- Modulo</code></pre>
<h3 id="big-o_notation">Big-O Notation</h3>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Big-O &#40;denoted as \(\mathcal{O}\)&#41; refers to the most accurate worst case analysis with regards to either</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Execution time

<ul>
<li><p>It always assumes the maximum number of iterations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conventions">Conventions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Constants get dropped from \(\mathcal{O}\) notation as it is small compared to infinity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: </p>
\[
\mathcal{O}(5n) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(n)
\]
<ul>
<li><p>Lower order terms get dropped in \(\mathcal{O}\) notation for the reason as before</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
\[
\mathcal{O}(n^{2} + 1000n - 3) \rightarrow \mathcal{O}(n^{2})
\]
<ul>
<li><p>Dropping constants theoretically is possible because constants do not grow towards infinity</p>
</li>
<li><p>In practice however, these constants can affect practical outcomes of algorithms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constant_complexity_mathcalo1">Constant Complexity: \(\mathcal{O}(1)\)</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Performance does not scale with input size</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example is having a list and returning the first item in the list:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-julia">mylist &#61; &#91;1:5...&#93;
first&#40;mylist&#41;</code></pre>
<h4 id="linear_complexity_mathcalon">Linear Complexity: \(\mathcal{O}(n)\)</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Performance does scale with size</p>

<li><p>Example is summing all elements in an array:</p>
</li>

<h4 id="logarithmic_complexity_mathcalologn">Logarithmic Complexity: \(\mathcal{O}(log(n))\)</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Performance scales logarithmically with input size</p>
</li>
<li><p>Base doesn&#39;t matter due to change of base:</p>
</li>
</ul>
\[

<li><p>It can intuitively be thought of the running time is proportional to the \(n\) <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://stackoverflow.com/a/2307307">Stack Overflow Explanation</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Another way to think about it is that the time goes up linearly while \(n\) increases exponentially <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://stackoverflow.com/a/2307330">Stack Overflow Explanation</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of this behavior is here:</p>
<table><tr><th align="right">Time &#40;\(t\)&#41;</th><th align="right">\(n\)</th></tr><tr><td align="right">0</td><td align="right">1</td></tr><tr><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">10</td></tr><tr><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">100</td></tr><tr><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">1000</td></tr><tr><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">10000</td></tr><tr><td align="right">5</td><td align="right">100000</td></tr></table>
<p>Where the proportion can be stated as:</p>
\[
f(n) = log_{10}(n^{t})
\]
<h4 id="exercises">Exercises</h4>
<p><em>The following exercises can be found <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-time-complexity-analysis/">here</a></em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the time and space complexity of:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-julia">a &#61; 0
i &#61; 0while i &lt; N
	a &#61; a &#43; rand&#40;1&#41;
	i &#43;&#61; 1
end
b &#61; 0
j &#61; 0while j &lt; M
	b &#61; b &#43; rand&#40;1&#41;
	j &#43;&#61; 1
end</code></pre>
<p>Answer: \(\mathcal{O}(N + M), \mathcal{O}(1)\)</p>
<p>Explanation: Since we measure complexity by worse case scenario of primitive operations ran, there could be \(N\) and \(M\) operations executed in this code. As no additional space is being utilized, space complexity is constant as no new variables are being defined.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>What is the time complexity of:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-julia">a &#61; 0
i &#61; 0
j &#61; Nwhile i &lt; N
	while j &gt; i
		a &#61; a &#43; i &#43; j
		j -&#61; 1
	end
	i &#43;&#61; 1
end</code></pre>
<p>Answer: \(\mathcal{O}(N \cdot N)\)</p>
<p>Explanation: Both loops are dependent on \(N\) so both loops, iterate \(N\) times, therefore resulting in a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(N \cdot N)\)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>What is the time complexity of the following code:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-julia">i &#61; N / 2
k &#61; 0while i &lt;&#61; N
	j &#61; 2
	while j &lt;&#61; N
		k &#61; k &#43; N / 2
		j *&#61; 2
	end
	i &#43;&#61; 1
end</code></pre>
<p>Answer: \(\mathcal{O}(n \cdot \log(n))\)</p>
<p>Explanation: As \(n\) continues to increase, the variable, \(k\) continues to loosely grow more than exponential. Furthermore, there are, \(\frac{n}{2}\) primitive steps in the outer loop such that the total time complexity would be \(\mathcal{O}(\frac{n}{2} \cdot \log{n})\) which is then simplified to \(\mathcal{O}(n \cdot \log(n))\) I got this wrong initially because I did not account for the outer loop contributing a time complexity of \(\frac{n}{2}\).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>What does it mean when we say that algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer: Algorithm X will always be better for large inputs</p>
<p>Explanation: When we consider an asymptote in terms of an algorithm, we also consider that algorithms &quot;growth&quot; over time. Meaning, that if you have some algorithm that is efficient at an asymptote, by nature of asymptotic analysis, that means it is &quot;good&quot; in the worst case scenario of that algorithm.</p>
<p>Addendum: I got this wrong when thinking about asymptotic notation as I failed to consider growth. I thought X would be better for all inputs to that algorithm but that would not be so in the case of possibly a smaller input to X.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>What is the time complexity of the following code:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-julia">a &#61; 0
i &#61; Nwhile i &gt; 0
	a &#43;&#61; i
	i /&#61; 2
end</code></pre>
<p>Answer: \(\mathcal{O}(\log{n})\)</p>
<p>Explanation: There is a direct proportional relationship between \(n\) and the final output.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><p>What best describes the useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer: Time and Memory</p>
<p>Explanation: Time dictates how long a program will evaluate for and memory dictates how much a program can evaluate</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><p>How is time complexity measured?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer: By counting the number of primitive operations in an algorithm on a given input size.</p>
<p>Explanation: Each primitive operation is generally assumed to evaluate at the cost of &quot;one&quot; for each operation.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>What will be the time complexity of the following code?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;&#33;–NOTE: SKIPPING FOR NOW–&gt;</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">i &#61; 0 
while i &lt; N
	i *&#61; k
end</code></pre>
<ol start="9">
<li><p>What will be the time complexity of the following code?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;&#33;–NOTE: SKIPPING FOR NOW–&gt;</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">value &#61; 0

	while j &lt; i
		value &#43;&#61; 1
		j &#43;&#61; 1
	end
	i &#43;&#61; 1
end</code></pre>
<ol start="10">
<li><p>Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) and \(\mathcal{O}(logn)\), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer: False</p>
<p>Explanation: Algorithm A could be faster on smaller inputs as compared to algorithm B</p>

<p>Bundles are when you group together medical services to a single price. Often, these bundles proprietary to vendors. To patients, the advantage to this is knowing where costs break down and to find who is charging the least. - Megan Denham</p>

<p>What follows is an actual note in my knowledge management system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Normal Science**Date:** May 22 2022**Summary:** An overview of what normal science is according to Thomas Kuhn.**Keywords:** #normal #science #characteristics #work #archive## BibliographyT. S. Kuhn and I. Hacking, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Fourth edition. Chicago ; London: The University of Chicago Press, 2012.## Notes### What Is &quot;Normal Science&quot;?According to Kuhn, *normal science*, is research based on past scientific accomplishments that are considered the foundation for that area of investigation. 
Generally, this is the area where most scientists spend their time. 
The research done in normal science can be theoretical or empirical.In the book, Kuhn referred to this as &quot;mop-up work&quot; and that this mopping up or &quot;filling out&quot; of science is what most scientists do.
Although language such as &quot;mop-up&quot; work can make one think that Kuhn was being pejorative to these so-called &quot;scut scientists&quot;, he did not intend it so. 
In later versions of this book, he made a response to this point of confusion and clarified that this work still is fascinating and crucial in many ways to the advancement of science.#### What Are the Characteristics of Normal Science?An important aspect of normal science is that it does not engage with or seek out anything new. 
The invention of theories, development of new phenomena - anything abnormal - is not part of normal science. 
Novelty is abhorrent and antithetical to normal science.Aside from this fundamental aspect of normal science, Kuhn posited that there are three general areas of research in normal science. 
He emphasized that they do not always hold or are always discrete from one another:1. Investigating questions around the fundamental facts found in a specific domain.
2. Questions that are predicted and expected to have answers existing within an already existing research domain.
3. Further articulating the fundamental facts held in a given domain.## References</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Develop and adhere to a regular data update schedule</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consider using the Common Data Layout</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know about ERISA limitations on private self-insured employer plans</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This was a summary paper detailing how to establish an All-Payers Claim Database with recommendations from 8 states across the US with All-Payer Claims Databases. It was a high value paper&#33; Lots of great insights in this document with good summary insights from across the states interviewed which were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Arkansas</p>
</li>
<li><p>Colorado</p>
</li>
<li><p>Maine</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minnesota</p>
</li>
<li><p>New Hampshire</p>
</li>
<li><p>Utah</p>
</li>
<li><p>Virginia</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wisconsin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the general insights were rather vague about what states actually <em>did</em> with their APCD. This paper gains even more benefit when read in conjunction with <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/08062021145920-benefits-state-apcds.md">Part 2 of this series</a>.</p>
<h3 id="intended_uses_of_all-payers_claim_databases">Intended Uses of All-Payers Claim Databases</h3>
<p><strong>Information transparency</strong> is disclosing and highlighting variation in:</p>

</li>
<li><p>cost</p>
</li>
<li><p>service quality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enables employers to choose value-based care. Consumers will know what options they have.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Public coverage programs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Public health.</p>

<p>The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership &#40;OMOP&#41; was created in 2009 to reach consensus on data types, study designs, and privacy concerns while sharing data.</p>
<p>The ground truth for OMOP investigations were positive and negative tests regarding drugs. Examples of positive controls were:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Events on drug label warnings/precautions
- If it was a causative agenda</code></pre>
<p>Examples of negative controls were:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">- Events not listed on drug labels
- No powered studies with evidence of potential positive association</code></pre>

<p>Cuebiq collects 1st party location data from over twenty five million active users daily.  The data covers the continental US and excludes Hawaii and Alaska.  Cuebiq brokers with 100&#43; applications to collect this location data. This creates a diversity of data from opted-in individuals while preserving anonymity. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<h3 id="mobility_metrics">Mobility Metrics</h3>
<p><strong>Shelter-In-Place:</strong> Percent of devices staying within 300 ft of home each day</p>
<p><strong>Cuebiq Contact Index:</strong> When &gt; 1 devices are within 50ft of one another for &gt; 5min. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p><strong>Cuebiq Mobility Index:</strong> How far devices move each day. It is calculated using a derivative factor indicating the distance between opposite corners of a box drawn around the locations observed for devices on each day. </p>

Guy et al., &quot;Association of State-Issued Mask Mandates and Allowing On-Premises Restaurant Dining with County-Level COVID-19 Case and Death Growth Rates — United States, March 1–December 31, 2020,&quot; MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep., vol. 70, no. 10, pp. 350–354, Mar. 2021, doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm7010e3.</p>

<h3 id="definitions_and_background">Definitions and Background</h3>
<p><strong>State-issued mask mandates:</strong> Required to wear masks at:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>Businesses and food establishments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>State-issued restaurant closures:</strong> Restaurants not operating or restricting service to takeout, curbside pickup, or delivery. </p>
<p><strong>Providing indoor or outdoor on-premises dining:</strong> State lifting a restaurant closure. No distinction was made on how restaurants reopened &#40;such as with reduced capacity, enhanced sanitation, etc.&#41;. Per states, if a bar served food, it was coded as a restaurant and if a bar did not serve food, there were bars.</p>
<h3 id="equations">Equations</h3>
<p>&#40;1&#41; Daily growth rate : </p>
\[
\ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - \ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - 1 * 100
\]
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>Analyses were weighted by county population; standard errors were robust to heteroscedasticity; clustered by state. </p>
<p>Relationship between policies and COVID-19 measured 1–20 days prior to implementation compared with seven mutually exclusive time ranges post-implementation. Associations were examined 60 - 41 and 40 - 21 days before implementation and 1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days after implementation.</p>
<p>COVID-19 case and death growth rates were compared via weighted least-squares regression with county and day fixed effects. Four regression models were used for associating mandates and COVID-19 growth rates by controlling for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restaurant closures in mask mandate models</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mask mandates in the restaurant reopening models</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bar closures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay-at-home orders</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bans on gatherings of &gt;&#61; 10 persons</p>
</li>
<li><p>Daily COVID-19 tests per 100000 persons</p>
</li>
<li><p>County</p>
</li>
<li><p>Day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QUESTION: I wonder how they controlled for these covariate variables?</em></p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates over these day ranges post-mask mandate implementation were seen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Permitting on-premises dining saw increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates</p>
<ul>
<li><p>41 - 60</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>days after reopening.</p>
<p>Increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates were observed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>61 - 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 - 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>days after reopening.</p>
<p>During March 1–December 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied in 2,313 &#40;73.6&#37;&#41; of the 3,142 U.S. counties. Post mask mandate COVID case growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20 days: -0.5&#37; &#40;p &#61; 0.02&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40 days: -1.1&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60 days: -1.5&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80 days: -1.7&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 -100 days: -1.8&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Post mask mandate COVID death growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - 20 days: -0.7&#37; &#40;p &#61; 0.03&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>21 - 40 days: -1.0&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>41 - 60 days: -1.4&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>61 - 80 days: -1.6&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>81 -100 days: -1.9&#37; &#40;p &lt; 0.01 for all&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>QUESTION: Oh so does this suggest that it took about 20 days before we started to see the lagging effects of these mandates?</em></p>
<p>After &gt; 40 days on-premises dining was permitted, increases in case and death growth rates were observed. Possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restaurants may have delayed reopening after on-premises dining allowed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restaurant patrons cautious at reopen but grew bolder as time passed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Models not control for other policies like: other types of business closures, physical distancing recommendations, policies issued by localities, and county-level policy variances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Policy compliance and enforcement not explored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No differentiating indoor and outdoor dining, ventilation, and following physical distancing and occupancy not investigated.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="study_purpose">Study Purpose</h3>
<p>Examined whether implementation of statewide mask mandates was associated with COVID-19–associated hospitalization growth rates among different age groups.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Statewide mask mandate:</strong> persons operating in a personal capacity must wear a mask</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Outside home</p>
</li>
<li><p>At businesses and in restaurants &amp; food establishments</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>COVID-NET Site:</strong> Group of counties within a state. Sites in states that did not have statewide mask mandates during March 1– October 17, 2020, were excluded from the analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Nonpharmaceutical Interventions &#40;NPIs&#41;:</strong> Actions taken to slow the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<h3 id="data_source">Data Source</h3>
<p><strong>COVID-NET:</strong> population-based surveillance system &#91;1&#93; that provides laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in 99 counties located in 14 states, beginning March 1, 2020 &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>For analyses, cumulative hospitalization rates for each week of the study period for seven age cohorts &#40;adults aged 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years&#41; were aggregated into three age groups &#40;18–39, 40–64, and ≥65 years&#41;.</p>
<p>Weekly cumulative hospitalization growth rate &#40;HGrowthast&#41; for age cohort a in site s during week t is defined as the weekly percentage change in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 persons, estimated by HGrowth<em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; &#40;&#40;log &#40;HR</em>&#123;ast&#125;&#41;-log &#40;HR<em>&#123;as&#40;t-1&#41;&#125;&#41;&#41;×100, where HR</em>&#123;ast&#125; &#61; cumulative hospitalization rate per 100,000 population for age cohort a in site s in week t. The log of the cumulative hospitalization growth rate is similar to the log of the cumulative cases per week, as the denominators are equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>For 40-64 year-olds, 2 weeks after statewide mask mandates: weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 2.9&#37;.</p>
<p>For 40-64, 18 - 39 year-olds, &gt;&#61; 3 weeks after statewide mask mandates: weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 5.5&#37;.</p>

<p>Reduction of non-response bias through the introduction of new weighting techniques. &#91;1&#93; <em>QUESTION: What is non-response bias and how do you adjust for that?</em></p>
<h3 id="how_reliability_and_validity_were_measured">How Reliability and Validity Were Measured</h3>
<p>High reliable papers included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conducted reliability tests using repeated test/retest measures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Used multiple samples/populations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Used multiple time periods.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ran statistical tests</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How authors achieved higher validity by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Comparing BRFSS to physical measures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Self-report on chronic conditions between BRFSS and surveys are highly reliable.</p>
<p>As time between conducting the same survey lapses, reliability for some questions decrease when re-asked. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Sometimes, self-reports from the BRFSS were very reliable but prevalence differed. <em>QUESTION: What does it mean when self-reports are highly reliable and prevalence rates still differ? Seems really strange and I am not sure why this would happen...</em></p>
<p>Similarities between BRFSS and other surveys using self-reports persisted across different modes of reporting like phone calls or in-person interviews. Researchers observed BRFSS reliability and validity for some cohorts but not for others. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>All surveys consistently showed the proportion of respondents indicating general health to be &quot;excellent&quot; was declining. <em>RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY</em></p>
<p>BRFSS physical activity measures and responses were compared sometimes to physical device measures.Prevalence variation estimates found occasionally; trends similar when comparing survey results over time. <em>QUESTION: Interesting how with devices prevalences did vary but trends were found to be similar across demographics. I wonder what reports did that? I&#39;ll stick a pin in this for now.</em></p>

<h3 id="conversation_with_jakob_nissen">Conversation with Jakob Nissen</h3>
<p>I was explained by Jakob Nissen, a Danish Bioinformatics PhD, that one can think of metapopulation analysis as follows:</p>
<p>The analysis has its foundation in ecology where the goal was to explore a specific species as a &quot;population of populations&quot;. For example, if you have a large area where there are many smaller habitats, a species can go extinct without causing a large problem for or impact on the overall area. This is because other species from nearby habitats will eventually move in to the old habitat of that species. Therefore, to ascertain the status of that species, the larger area needs to be considered</p>
<p>When I asked about how one could map these approach to humans, Jakob had the following idea:</p>
<p>One could model society as a large group of social bubbles where people see other people inside the bubble in the context of epidemics. So perhaps here, the virus is going extinct in social bubbles and migrating from bubble to bubble.</p>
<p>This gave some good thoughts on approaches for metapopulation-based analysis to epidemics/pandemics.</p>

<p>OMOP Common Data Model &#40;CDM&#41;: effort to standardize observational data to enable transferable analysis. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<h3 id="omop_cdm_design_elements">OMOP CDM Design Elements</h3>
<p>The OMOP CDM features person­centric design where each domain records personal identity and a ate while prioritizing data protection through the limiting of information that could endanger patient anonymity. The CDM relies on Standardized Vocabularies and attempts to reuse existing vocabularies where it can. Furthermore, to prevent data loss, the CDM stores original patient source codes.</p>
<p>The CDM itself does not require a specific technology to work with the data stored in this standard. As a result of this, all versions of the CDM are backwards compatible Even more the CDM is scalable for data processing and analy­sis</p>
<h3 id="omop_cdm_conventions">OMOP CDM Conventions</h3>
<p>The CDM is person ­centric meaning tha all clinical Event tables are linked to the<code>PERSON</code> table. Tables that need to be manipulated by users are stored in the &quot;Results&quot; schema. The two tables in the &quot;Results&quot; schema are: <code>COHORT</code> and <code>COHORT_DEFINITION</code>. The data types defined in these tables are ANSI SQL:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>VARCHAR</p>
</li>
<li><p>INTEGER</p>
</li>
<li><p>FLOAT</p>
</li>
<li><p>DATE</p>
</li>
<li><p>DATETIME</p>
</li>
<li><p>CLOB</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="omop_cdm_concepts">OMOP CDM &quot;Concept&quot;&#39;s</h3>
<p>All content in the OMOP CDM is a concept. They form relationships with one another in a hierarchical manner. This concept information is stored in the following tables:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>CONCEPT</code> - the concepts in the CDM</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP</code> - the relationships between concepts</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CONCEPT_ANCESTOR</code> - hierarchical concept relationships; see <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07282021202459-exploring-ancestors-concept.md">Exploring Ancestors and Descendants of a Concept</a></p>

</ul>
<p>One can query <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07282021211226-drug-concepts.md">drug concepts by name</a> easily in OHDSI tools.</p>
<h3 id="use_cases_for_the_omop_cdm">Use Cases for the OMOP CDM</h3>
<p>The OMOP CDM is implemented to help with Big Health Data collection. We use Big Health Data because it:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enables research</p>
</li>
<li><p>Backs effective healthcare</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manages healthcare claims</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The CDM is optimized for typical observational research purposes such as</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Identifying patient populations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Characterize populations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determining effects of population-based interventions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Organize data for analysis</p>
</li>

<p>Iterative proportional fitting &#91;1&#93; was used to make POI –&gt; <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/01202021043013-census-groups.md">CBG</a> networks from SafeGraph data. SafeGraph mobility data was validated against Google mobility data.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: What is iterative proportional fitting?</em></p>
<p>Model fits observed daily case counts from 8 March to 9 May 2020</p>
<h3 id="points_of_interest">Points of Interest</h3>
<p>POI hourly infection rate determined via:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Area</p>
</li>
<li><p>Median visit duration</p>
</li>
<li><p>Time-varying density of infectious individuals</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Three free time-invariant parameters that scale:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>POI transmission rates</p>
</li>
<li><p>CBG transmission rates</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initial amount of exposed individuals</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Points of interest for this paper are such as: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Restaurants</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grocery stores</p>
</li>
<li><p>Religious establishments</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Certain categories of POIs contributed far more to infections like restaurants and hotels The model predicted time-dependent variation - likely due to policy change.</p>
<p>Model can identify at-risk populations and determined that disadvantaged racial socioeconomic groups face higher rates of infection.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: This conclusion seems very obvious – of course people are going to have to move and keep doing things.</em></p>
<h3 id="counterfactual_mobility_network">Counterfactual Mobility Network</h3>
<p>Counterfactual mobility network creation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Scaling magnitude of mobility reduction down</p>
</li>
<li><p>Positioning the model at different times</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apply model to counterfactual networks to simulate infection trajectories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: What is a counterfactual network? I wonder in what sense they are using the word &quot;counterfactual&quot;?</em></p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>Limitations of dataset:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some populations missing</p>
</li>
<li><p>All POIs not ID&#39;d</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does not break up CBGs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The model is sparse.  It does not include all real-world disease transmission variables.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>COVID-19 superspreader events &#91;2&#93;–&#91;5&#93; motivate risk modeling. Infection rates among different people groups &#91;6&#93;–&#91;12&#93; require modeling effects of the virus on disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The observed disparity was driven by a few POIs. Majority of infections from small fraction of superspreader POIs.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably because they cannot work from home as easily.&quot; &#91;10&#93;</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: It almost feels insulting that after this entire analysis, there is only one footnote on the topic of what people actually experience. On the flip side, I can empathize where a research group could lack time and/or means to contextualize results. Either way, it feels ripe to build on top of this work/paper to better examine the actual effects of policy adjustments and life changes.</em></p>
<p>CBGs with fewer white residents had higher predicted infection risks.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: Seems somewhat odd? This is interesting to me in how they keep bringing up race or economic status as a variable, but never fully commit to an investigation. Feels really weird to talk about issues without actually addressing them.</em></p>
<p>Mobility data showed average grocery store visits from lower-income CBGs had 59&#37; more hourly visitors per square foot. Median metro area data showed they stayed 17&#37; longer.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<h4 id="review_process">Review Process</h4>
<p>First stage, a white European male&#39;s reflection on academic research in DRC and setting up Marakuja Kive Research group.  Second stage, two Congolese researchers and Marakuja Kive Research founders review ideas in initial draft.</p>
<p>Retreating to safety founded on racial inequality creates a resource for researchers to access - consciously or not. This is often hard to identify due to delicacy of research endeavors. In Africa, is race colonial legacy or a resource for projects actively relied on, or both?</p>
<h4 id="research_projects_are_a_lucrative_business">Research Projects Are a Lucrative Business</h4>
<p>International research projects are beginning to much more resemble supply chains &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Increased demands for data in research enabled businesses based on multi-actor business models and knowledge value chains to exist &#91;2&#93; Quantitative research is closer to the big data sector. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Three main groups of people enable the collection of data. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Western, generally white researchers control project resources; namely funding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Non-Western associates: their work is usually hidden from outputs &#91;4&#93;, &#91;5&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Subjects who are generally from lower socio-economic positioning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: Point 1 reminds me of the Communist Manifesto by Marx on those that control the means of production.</em></p>
<p>Data derives its value from its rawness at extraction and via processing.  International academic pipeline construction is analogous to generic resource mining: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>African data is collected</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exported</p>
</li>
<li><p>Processed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Converted to high value goods &#40;papers, reports, etc.&#41;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This mirrors very closely how international academic endeavors can look like a supply chain.</p>
<h4 id="accidental_whiteness">Accidental Whiteness</h4>
<p>White academics incidentally separate to give themselves a sense of racial inapplicability &#91;6&#93;, &#91;7&#93;</p>

<h3 id="the_failure_of_the_publication_machine">The Failure of the Publication Machine</h3>
<p>Publication has been extended beyond usefulness of the record. Current methods for finding relevant information is impractical.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: Very convicting retrospection on how we handle copious amounts of information. A record which contains too little information is not informative and one that contains too much is overwhelming.</em></p>
<p>Those who try to stay current with research may have difficulty to recall last month&#39;s material studied.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: This is so convicting&#33; Even though it is a nearly 80 year old paper, the problems that he discusses are still in existence&#33;  The problem of having too many papers and the inability to extract the truly worthwhile pieces of information are still present.</em></p>
<h3 id="the_idea_of_automated_knowledge_systems">The idea of Automated Knowledge Systems</h3>
<p>When one associates information along logical processes, creativity is limited to data selection to match a process. After this initial surge of creativity, the work is fit for automation</p>
<h3 id="regarding_thought">Regarding Thought</h3>
<p>There exist no substitute for nuanced thinking. Imagination and repetitious thinking are diverse. Repetitive thought is much easier automated.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: I like this notion of repetitive thought. As much as there are repetitive thought, there are repetitive actions accordingly.</em></p>

<p><strong>Loop Invariant:</strong> a statement which explains why an algorithm is correct. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>It is comprised of three steps: Initialization: The statement is valid before the first iteration of the loop. Maintenance: If it is true before a loop iteration, it remains true throughout the loop. Termination: At the loop&#39;s end, the invariant yields a property to aid in showing the algorithm works expectedly.</p>

<p>This book shows that data is stupid. Data can record events but cannot answer why any of the events are the way they are.</p>
<p>Causal inference posits the brain as the most advanced tool for understanding cause and effect.</p>
<p>Forcing an occurrence means to submit it to one influence to trigger the desired event</p>
<p><strong>Counterfactual:</strong> When scientific inquiry involves retrospective reflection. &quot;Why?&quot; is a counterfactual question.</p>
<p>Probabilities encode our beliefs about a static world. Causality explains probabilities in a changing world.</p>
<h3 id="benefits_of_causal_analysis">Benefits of Causal Analysis</h3>
<p>Create a smoother human-machine interface.</p>
<p><em>THOUGHTS: I wonder if that is what attracted me to the idea of Causal Inference - that it enables better human-machine interfaces. Like human-machine interaction as a discipline; I wonder if they have much in this area. Perhaps reach out to Valentine Wilson about the question?</em></p>
<h3 id="critiques_of_statistics">Critiques of Statistics</h3>
<p>Galton separated causation from statistics in 1889 causing the two separate fields to fully manifest.</p>
<p>&quot;Granger causality&quot; and &quot;vector autocorrelation&quot; exists to accommodate for causal explanations. Associated Thoughts: Judea&#39;s critique on probability-based causality</p>
<h3 id="causal_calculus">Causal Calculus</h3>
<p>Causal calculus uses two communications forms: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Causal Diagrams: communicates what is known.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic language: defines what is wanted to be known</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="inference_engine">Inference Engine</h3>
<p>The inference engine assumes perfect and unlimited data for the given figure:</p>
<p><img src="assets/01082021030619-inference-engine.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Estimand:</strong> generalized mathematical formula to answer data questions. A statistical quantity estimated from data that can represent an answer to a query.</p>
<p>A given estimand is computed on the basis of the causal model alone, prior to an examination of the specifics of the data. This gives the inference engine better adaptibility.</p>
<p><strong>Binary Evaluation of Query:</strong> determines if a query can be answered under an existing causal model.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge:</strong> experience from the past such as prior observations and education.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> explicit statements from available Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Queries:</strong> the scientific questions to be answered.</p>
<p><strong>Testable Implications:</strong> observable patterns or dependencies resulting from the listening pattern of a causal model.</p>
<p><strong>Estimate:</strong> Estimate for the answer is determined alongside uncertainty metrics.The metrics reflect limited data, measurement errors, or missing data.</p>
<h3 id="ladder_of_causality">Ladder of Causality</h3>
<p>First rung: observation. This concerns recognition of patterns. This rung asks, &quot;What if I see ...?&quot;</p>
<p>The second rung: Doing. Altering an environment to achieve a certain goal. This rung poses the questions of &quot;What if we do...?&quot; or &quot;How?&quot;</p>
<h3 id="mini-turing_test">Mini-Turing Test</h3>
<p>Mini-Turing Test: Encode a simple story on a machine and see if it can answer causal questions a human can answer.</p>
<p>Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Limited only to causal reasoning and language.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The story can be encoded in the easiest way for the programmer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bayesian_analysis">Bayesian Analysis</h3>
<p>Simplified Bayesian analysis: prior belief &#43; new evidence &#61; revised belief.</p>
<p>Bayesian inference enables one to express personal experiences mathematically and combine it with data in a principled and transparent way.</p>
<h3 id="causal_diagrams">Causal Diagrams</h3>
<p>&quot;Causation&quot; via a causal diagram is straightforward. A variable X is a cause of Y if Y listens to X. Y&#39;s value is determined by what it hears.</p>
<h4 id="paths_in_path_diagrams">Paths in Path Diagrams</h4>
<h5 id="chain_junction">Chain junction</h5>
\[
A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C
\]
<p>B is the mediator which relays the effect of A to C. B filters information about A from C.</p>
<h5 id="fork_junction">Fork Junction</h5>
\[
A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C
\]
<p>B is a confounder of A and C. B makes A and C statistically correlated despite no direct link between them.</p>
<h5 id="collider_junction">Collider Junction</h5>
\[
A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C
\]
<p>Conditioning on B will make A and C dependent</p>
<h4 id="lessons_from_path_diagrams">Lessons from Path Diagrams</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Causal analysis allows us to quantify real world processes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Path analysis draws conclusions about individual causal relationships by examining the diagram as a whole.</p>

<p>ICA seeks to minimize mutual information between projections.Independent component analysis finds a coordinate frame onto which the projection of the data has minimal temporal overlap. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>ICA is considered a linear decomposition alternative to principal component analysis &#40;PCA&#41;. In PCA, the data is represented using perpendicular axes. ICA is not limited by this constraint &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>ICA has been applied to domains such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fMRI</p>
</li>
<li><p>performing speech</p>
</li>
<li><p>noise separation &#91;3&#93;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ICA decompositions are best for sources linearly mixed in a recorded signal.</p>

<p><strong>Running time:</strong> the number of basic operations executed in an algorithm. In the RAM model, each executed line takes the constant time ci.</p>
<p>Generally, time taken by an algorithm grows in proportion to the size of the input. &#91;1&#93; Definitions for input size depend on what is studied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The number of items in the input</p>

<h3 id="assessment_of_ehrs">Assessment of EHRs</h3>
<p>US Department of Health and Human Services&#39; &#40;HHS&#41; Office of the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology &#40;ONC&#41; specifies standards for EHR systems. This is to ensure that EHRs meet &quot;Meaningful Use&quot; criteria.</p>
<p>EHR data is generally from patients who have the means of seeing a provider. &#91;1&#93; This data may be available from different encounters. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inpatient</p>
</li>
<li><p>Outpatient</p>
</li>
<li><p>Emergency department visits</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations_of_ehrs">Limitations of EHRs</h3>
<p>EHRs are not optimized for secondary uses. They have multiple limitations for research &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93; EHR data is recorded during healthcare visitations. As a result, bias can favor those sicker in datasets. This results in what is known as informative censoring &#91;1&#93;, &#91;3&#93;, &#91;4&#93; It is important to distinguish between &quot;not present&quot; in datasets versus &quot;did not assess&quot;.</p>
<p>Errors propagate EHRs and ancillary sources. Data is entered by providers during visitation or memory. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Healthcare standards change over time. Collection standards vary by location. Much data is unstructured and narrative in nature. <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/01112021180936-we-may-think.md">Vannevar Bush article &quot;As We May Think&quot;</a> also has relation to this very same issue. Regarding how clinicians&#39; recall or anyone&#39;s recall of an incident from more than a few days ago may be impossible. There are analogies between the two disparate lines of thought: one clinical, the other academic: both overwhelming.</p>
<p>Only a few data fields are common across different EHRs. Most phenotype definitions use combinations of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ICD-9 codes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Medication names</p>
</li>
<li><p>Laboratory tests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>EHRs will use ICD-10 codes for diagnoses and potentially SNOMED-CT codes for problem lists and other aspects of EHRs.  EHRs also consist of free form text where Natural Language Processing could be of use. &#91;5&#93; ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes can be found in technical billing, professional billing, and/or problem lists.</p>

<h3 id="methods_and_materials">Methods and Materials</h3>
<p>Changes in population movement based on stay-at-home orders between March 1–May 31, 2020 given by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories were examined.</p>
<h4 id="classifying_stay-at-home_orders">Classifying Stay-at-Home Orders</h4>
<p>Coding of orders was based solely on the legal language in each state or territorial order. Stay-at-home orders were assigned a mutually exclusive category based on this language:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All required &#40;language examples: persons &quot;shall,&quot; &quot;must,&quot; or &quot;are directed to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Applied to persons in specific jurisdictions&#39; locations &#40;language examples: persons &quot;shall,&quot; &quot;must,&quot; or &quot;are directed to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Required for individuals &gt; 65 years or with underlying conditions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mandatory for individuals &gt; 65 years or with underlying conditions in specific jurisdictions&#39; locations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not required but advised to stay home &#40;language examples: persons &quot;should,&quot; &quot;are encouraged to,&quot; or &quot;are urged to&quot;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jurisdictions that did not issue an order were coded as having no state- or territory-issued order</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="determining_time_windows">Determining Time Windows</h4>
<p>Given a state &quot;s&quot; that issues a stay-at-home order at date &quot;t&quot;, pre- and post-order windows for each county, &quot;c&quot;, in a state can be defined. c&#39;s preorder window contains movement values, m, during the time period before, t. The postorder window contains m values during the time period after t. Each county&#39;s preorder window serves as a county- and COVID-specific baseline. Small time values observed during these periods reflect county-specific invariants and impacts of the pandemic on behavior in the absence of state- or territory-issued community mitigation policies. ***QUESTION:** What is a sufficiently small value of n-days &#40;or time period before and after t&#41;?* ***QUESTION:** What is a county-specific invariant?*</p>
<p>Order index date types:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each jurisdiction&#39;s counties</p>
</li>
<li><p>Waning or end of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each jurisdiction&#39;s counties</p>
</li>
<li><p>Date of the first state stay-at-home order</p>
</li>
<li><p>Date of the first termination of a state stay-at-home order</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="analyzing_for_changes_in_population_movement_patterns">Analyzing for Changes in Population Movement Patterns</h4>
<p>Counties were broken into rural-urban categories to ensure groupings of counties with similar population sizes. Box plots were constructed for each category to examine the distribution of county mean percentages of devices at home during the pre- and postorder periods associated with each index date. Movement values following a normal distribution was not assumed for all counties and periods.  A clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test was then performed, with counties as clusters, on the constituent counties&#39; median pre- and post-order values associated with each index date. A lower-tailed test was used for dates regarding the start of regional mandates. An upper-tailed test was used for dates recording the end of regional mandates. Strata-level statistical significance was assessed at the 99&#37; confidence level &#40;alpha &#61; 0.01&#41;. <em>Dataset used: <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/documentation/">The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#39;s Rural-Urban Continuum Codes</a> are used to stratify counties in this analysis</em> <strong>QUESTION:</strong> What is a &quot;clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test&quot;?_</p>
<p>Population movement was inferred via the percentage of individual devices reported each day that were home for each county. A 7-day rolling average was used to smooth each county&#39;s pre- and postorder time series values ***QUESTION:** I wonder how good a metric this observation serves as a proxy of measuring population movement?*</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<h4 id="general_insights">General Insights</h4>
<p>Regions which issued stay-at-home mandates saw general declines in population movement. At the same time as the first state relaxed their mandate, regions that had not relaxed their mandates saw increased population movement. Stay-at-home orders can reduce activities associated with community spread of COVID-19. This includes population movement and external person-to-person contact.</p>
<h4 id="limitations_of_this_analysis">Limitations of this analysis</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Device coverage correlates with US pop density.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, certain regions or groups might be inequitably represented. ***QUESTION:** How does relative device coverage largely correlate with US pop density?*</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>People may have multiple mobile devices and might take any number of them when they leave home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test is used with counties as clusters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is because a county&#39;s median pre- and postorder values are paired comparisons. Possible spatial dependence between counties wasn&#39;t addressed.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>The report does not account for nationwide protests affects on mobility patterns.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The only relationship analyzed was between stay-at-home orders and population movement.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="operational_definitions">Operational Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Phenotype:</strong> a measurable biological, behavioral, or cognitive marker found more often in specific individuals than the general population; the appearance it presents to observers.&#91;1&#93;</p>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/./08122022205622-assessing-phenotype-fairness.md"><strong>Phenotyping:</strong></a> Identifying a set of patients with a particular disease </p>
<p><strong>Computable phenotype:</strong> a clinical element that can derived from queries to an EHR or ancillary data sources &#40;such as claims data, or disease registries&#41; using a defined set of data elements and logical expressions.  It does not require chart review or interpretation by a clinician. </p>
<p><strong>Data element:</strong> the unit of data being queried, exchanged, or analyzed. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Descriptive name for the concept</p>
</li>
<li><p>A specified value set</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional metadata</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Value set:</strong> the set of possible information associated with a particular data element. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong> descriptive data about objects, including data objects; data about data.</p>
<h3 id="computable_phenotypes_definitions">Computable Phenotypes Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Computable phenotype definitions:</strong> classifying individuals with a given characteristic of interest from EHRs. Done by using data routinely collected in EHRs or ancillary data sources &#40;such as claims data, or disease registries&#41;.</p>
<p>Computable phenotype definitions enable reproducible queries of EHRs. They are made of data elements and boolean operators which are executed by a computer. Furthermore, they rely on value sets derived from standardized coding systems.</p>
<p>These definitions help identify people with particular conditions across healthcare organizations by using common definitions. Standard phenotype definitions can enable direct identification of cohorts. This allows decision-makers to specifically target screening tests and interventions to such cohorts.</p>

<p>An arithmetic sequence is one which the difference between one term and the next only differs by a constant. One example is this:</p>
\[
1+2+3+\cdots+n
\]
<p>where the difference between each proceeding term is the constant value, 1.</p>
<p>An arithmetic series is one in which values in an arithmetic sequence are summed together:</p>
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k=1+2+\cdots+n
\]
<p>This is a visual proof of the Arithmetic Series algorithm:</p>
<p><img src="01052021044019-pwow-arithmetic-mean.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A formalization of the above is:</p>
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} = \frac{n(a_{1} + a_{n})}{2}
\]
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} = \frac{a_{n}(a_{1} + a_{n})}{2}
\]
<p>The latter formalization is somewhat more common and it works as \(a_{n}\) gives the same values as what the size of the sequence is which is \(n\). From the visual proof, the \(\frac{n}{2}\) constant comes from halving the size of each region.</p>
<p>&#40;Thanks to Mark Kittisopikul, Yingbo Ma, and Benoit Pasquier for these explanations&#41;</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The goal of APCDs is to improve affordability of healthcare, its efficiency, and cost transparency. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>All-payer claims databases: State databases which contain the following information on private and public payers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Medical claims</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pharmacy claims</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dental claims</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eligibility and provider files</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Insurers are usually mandated by the state to provide APCD data to States.</p>
<h3 id="advantages_of_apcds_over_other_federal_health_datasets">Advantages of APCDs over other federal health datasets</h3>
<p>APCDs contain private insurance. This is not common for other datasets.</p>
<p>APCDs contain data from most or all insurance companies in a State. Other datasets do not have them.</p>
<p>APCDs include info on care for patients across care sites rather than only from discharge data systems. APCDs include large sample sizes, geographic representation, and capture of longitudinal information on a wide range of individual patients.</p>

<p>EEG data from rapid go/nogo visual categorization via natural photographs &#91;1&#93; Though the task involved complicated visual processing, averaged EEG epochs for target and non-target stimuli differed greatly as early as 150 ms after stimulus onset. It appeared to involve automated processing in the visual system.&#91;2&#93; <em>QUESTION: What is a go/nogo visual categorization task?</em></p>
<p><strong>EEG inverse problem:</strong> reconstructing intracranial brain sources from collected signals.Disparate EEG processes generally overlap in time and space. They become intertwined in scalp electrode recordings. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Subjects were presented pictures for 20 ms at random intervals between 1.8–2.2s. Half of the pictures were animals. Subjects released a held button when an animal was observed. Subject accuracy was 94&#37; for correct responses. Median reaction time was 440 ms</p>

<h3 id="general_insights">General Insights</h3>
<p>This study provides a template for understanding large economic shocks as they happen to counter the problem of data availability during major economic shocks. The start of the pandemic saw an unprecedented decline in economic activity in the US. The largest single month decline in US unemployment was 14 percent in April 2020.</p>
<p>The federal government&#39;s response totalled to nearly three trillion dollars spent to counter pandemic effects. Their response comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Economic Impact Payments &#40;tax rebates&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Small business loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Massive increase in unemployment insurance as part of the CARES Act</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methods_of_research">Methods of Research</h3>
<p>Basic Monthly Current Population Survey &#40;Monthly CPS&#41;, was used due to its quick release to understand the impact of macroeconomic conditions and government policies on US families&#39; incomes.</p>
<p>Family income from respondents in their first or fifth month in the survey were observed for a monthly sample ranging from 8,999 households and 20,822 individuals in February 2020 to 6,149 households and 14,383 individuals in April 2020.  Monthly CPS data from IPUMS-CPS &#91;1&#93; Generally, 90&#37; of earnings are reported in CPS, as opposed to ~60&#37; of unemployment insurance. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="key_conclusions">Key Conclusions</h3>
<p>Without US government intervention, poverty would have risen by 2.7 percentage points between January and June.</p>
<p>The COVID Impact survey &#91;3&#93; finds an increase in food insecurity when compared to a different earlier survey while the Census Bureau&#39;s Household Pulse survey &#91;4&#93; finds high rates of inability to pay rent.  These sources suggest increased hardship after the pandemic. The increase in deprivation is not due to the overall income loss, but rather due to other disruptions of the pandemic, including possibly the unevenness of the income flows.</p>
<p>Disruptions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Closures of schools</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stores</p>
</li>
<li><p>Churches and other facilities</p>
</li>
<li><p>The uncertainty about future income streams</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concerns about the health of family and friends</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other disruptions</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not believe the author is very familiar with the notion of mutltimodal analysis or standard data fusion methodologies. This was such a strange article that was more excitement and jubilation over the phenomenon of the possibility of computable phenotypes that I think the author was distracted from the message they were trying to convey. Though, they did talk about some applications regarding lung injury and sepsis, there was nothing really to suggest novelty in their assessment.</p>
<p>I reviewed this author&#39;s work and it appears the author has no formal training in informatics or analytics. So, I do not fault them for this article - however, to me, it read like something out of MIT Technology Review or a Science &amp; Technology Magazine. Not a professional scientific publication.</p>

<p>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging &#40;fMRI&#41; finds levels of electrical brain activity.Great at determining where brain activity is. &#91;1&#93; fMRI imaging was used to show activation patterns in spatially separated, though in-sync, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12282020003106-dynamic-functional-connectivity.md">brain region activity</a>. It has become clear there is a spatial and temporal periodicity in the brain that probably reflects some of the constant processes of the brain.</p>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>1,451 figures were examined from 288 neuroscience papers in 2010.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>They investigated current practices in data visualization in the realm of neuroscience and offered potential improvements to better reveal data than hide it.</p>
<p>Using work by Howard Wainer, Allen and co developed questions that were used to determine the effectiveness of particular visualizations.  These were the questions they came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Quantity of interest labeled?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scale of the dependent variable indicated?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Measure of uncertainty displayed &#40;as needed&#41;?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is the type of uncertainty &#40;e.g., standard error bars or confidence intervals&#41; defined in the figure or accompanying legend?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Interesting how they based it off of Wainer.  That paper on depicting error may be worth a read.</em></p>

<p>Efficient method introduced to analyze rapidly changing functional patterns is by transforming fMRI <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12282020020156-brain-biomarkers.md">BOLD</a> data to point processes. &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93; Achieved by selecting peaks of the BOLD signal in each <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11302020054820-voxel.md">voxel</a>. This reduction of data by &gt; 95&#37;, has been found very similar to inferences of functional connectivity from full signal analysis. &#91;3&#93;, &#91;4&#93;</p>
<p><em>QUESTION: What is a point process? Why is BOLD important?</em></p>
<h3 id="common_perceptions_of_neuroscience_visualizations">Common Perceptions of Neuroscience Visualizations</h3>
<p>Researchers may choose values for great visual appeal and easier interpretation. However, it reduces the analysis to a binary representation that suffers from the limitations of all-or-none hypothesis testing. &#91;5&#93;</p>
<p>Aesthetically pleasing brain image results are viewed more persuasive and credible than identical information presented in less appealing formats. &#91;6&#93;, &#91;7&#93;</p>
<p>Effective data visualization communicates that the data displayed does contain some uncertainty and that it quantifies that uncertainty as it pertains to conclusions one would make off the visualization. &#91;8&#93; - <em>Thoughts by Howard Wainer</em></p>
<h4 id="bar_plots">Bar Plots</h4>
<p>The usage of Bar Plots in neuroscience can certainly be beneficial but are not without their drawbacks:</p>
<p><strong>Pros of bar plots</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Easy to generate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Straightforward to comprehend</p>
</li>
<li><p>Efficiently contrast a large number of conditions in a small space.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Great for binary data samples that reflect successes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons of bar plots</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Commonly used in scenarios where distance from zero is not meaningful</p>
</li>
<li><p>Doesn&#39;t show distributional information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key_takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>To better improve understanding of figures, integrating descriptions into the figure itself can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discourages misinterpretation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lead to quicker understanding of figure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional annotation should not detract from figure</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependent variables are more difficult to label when they represent abstract parameter estimates rather than directly measured quantities. Uncertainty is more challenging to render when data sets require error surfaces rather than error bars.  Displays should become increasingly informative regarding complex data in illustrating relationships that would not be well defined in tables or values alone.</p>

<p><em>QUESTION: One thing that I realize and think a lot about from this paper is the question of: how easy is it to represent this sort of additional information that tells more the story of the neuroscientific data? Obviously, the authors have expertise with making their own tools.  But what about for those who do not have them?</em></p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>Connectograms based on diffusion MRI data employ graphs to demonstrate white matter connections and cortical characteristics. Connectograms can inform treatment of patients with neuroanatomical abnormalities. They can also be used for average cortical metrics and tractography data, across populations of any size.</p>

<p>Contact tracing is the identification, monitoring, and support of individuals who have been exposed to an infected person and were possibly infected. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Case investigation: identifying and investigating persons with confirmed and probable diagnoses. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p><strong>Close contact:</strong> any individual within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient is isolated.</p>
<p>Steps for contact tracing:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Case investigation: have patient recall everyone that they may have exposed themselves to while infectious.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contact tracing: notify exposed individuals of their potential exposure, while preserving privacy</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contact support: Educate, inform, and support exposed persons about their risk, steps to protect others, and to watch for sickness illness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Self-quarantine: Contacts are encouraged to stay home and maintain social distance from others until 14 days after their last exposure to the infected patient, in case they also become ill.</p>

<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>Dynamic functional connectivity refers to functional connectivity changing over a short time.  The primary tool for analyzing DFC is <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12282020003750-functional-mri.md">fMRI</a>. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>DFC is related to a variety of different neurological disorders, and has been suggested to be a more accurate representation of functional brain networks.</p>
<p>Functional networks of the brain fluctuate on the scale of seconds to minutes. The changes are generally movements from one short term state to another, rather than continuous shifts. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>There exist a few different types of stability in the kinds of brain analysis. &#91;3&#93; Here are a few with there associated descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dynamic functional activity: shown a distinct hierarchical organization of the networks of the brain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bilaterally symmetric regions: most stable form of connectivity in the brain</p>
</li>
<li><p>Direct anatomical connection: similar to bilaterally symmetric regions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Steady state functional connectivity: have less temporal stability than anatomical connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11302020054836-sliding-window-analysis.md">Sliding window analysis</a> is most common for functional connectivity and was first introduced in 2009. &#91;4&#93; Sliding window analysis is performed on DFC data by conducting analysis on a set number of scans in an fMRI session. The number of scans is the length of the sliding window.  The defined window is then moved a certain number of scans forward in time and additional analysis is performed.  The movement of the window is usually referenced in terms of the degree of overlap between adjacent windows. Data from sliding window analysis generally must be compared between two different groups to prove accuracy.</p>
<p>THOUGHT: This is very similar to analysis with <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03272020064312-exponential-smoothing.md">exponential smoothing</a> or <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04252020024813-median-filtering.md">&quot;salt-and-pepper&quot; filtering</a> and reminiscent of convolution filtering.</p>

<p>Functional connectivity refers to the functionally integrated relationship between spatially separated brain regions.  Functional connectivity is related to similar patterns of activation in different brain regions regardless of the apparent physical connectedness of the regions. &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Functional connectivity is usually measured during resting state <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12282020003750-functional-mri.md">fMRI</a>. &#91;3&#93; This is predicated on the assumption that functional connections in the brain remain constant in a short time over a task or period of data collection. Generally examined items based on temporal similarities during analysis of the brain are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correlation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Coherence</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spatial grouping</p>

<p>Imagine that I, your humble sorter, is seated in front of 10 cards each with a value between the numbers of 1 - 10. Every single card is face up and is in a line with each card next to the other. I know you want the cards sorted, so what I do, since I am somewhat slow, is look through every single card in that line and find the smallest valued card.</p>
<p>I take the smallest card and start a new row of cards which are sorted from the smallest valued card to the largest valued card. I then repeat this process and take the next smallest value and put it next to the smallest card I found. I continue this back and forth process until all the cards are sorted. That is tiring, but this method of sorting is called selection sort&#33;</p>

<p>The way sliding window analysis works is to analyze each voxel across an axis and project it to a final array that does not contain the axis upon which analysis took place. In this picture, each <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/11302020054820-voxel.md">voxel</a> across the z-axis at location <code>&#91;1, 1&#93;</code>, where <code>&#91;1, 1&#93;</code> is a <code>&#40;x, y&#41;</code> coordinate pair, is being summed up and divided by the number of values present to produce a simple mean. The voxels being summed are highlighted pink.</p>
<p><img src="11302020062728.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As shown in the above picture, the algorithm then continues this process until the array determined by the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> dimensions of the cube, in this case a <code>&#40;3, 3&#41;</code> array, is filled.</p>

<p>Stereographic projection is used to project a sphere to a 2D plane.  The algorithm in Cartesian coordinates looks like this:</p>
\[
[1] \ (X, Y) = (\frac{x}{1 - z}, \frac{y}{1 - z})
\]
\[
[2] \ (X, Y, Z)=\left(\frac{2 X}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}}, \frac{2 Y}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}}, \frac{-1+X^{2}+Y^{2}}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}}\right)

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>A core problem regarding reproducible neuroscience is that there has been no widely adopted standard for describing data from an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data difficult.&#91;1&#93; Furthermore, it complicates automation and quality assurance.</p>
<p>The BIDS format was inspired by the work done by the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/https://openneuro.org/">OpenNeuro</a> community to easily share and structure their data regarding pertaining to neuroscientific research. It enables development of automated tools to operate on datasets. &#91;1&#93; Common standards minimize curation&#33; Helps those not involved to effectively understand the data.</p>
<h3 id="specific_data_specifications">Specific data specifications:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Raw data derivatives should be separate from source data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The NIfTI image file format was selected as it is the most ubiquitous across neuroimaging software.BIDS requires users to provide additional meta information in a sidecar JSON file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Metadata is generally stored as an array in tab-delimited values.</p>
</li>
<li><p>JSON files are used for storing key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The key names follow a fixed dictionary in the specification.</p>
<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>
<p>Neuroimaging: brain imaging to gain quantitative brain data. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Error reduction: errors attributed to misunderstanding data.</p>
<p>Provenance: information regarding actions or those involved in producing an object. It can be used to form assessments about its valour.</p>

<p>The arrow format allows for larger-than-memory datasets. When writing a dataset to arrow format, the data and metadata is laid in a descriptive layout. The data is written in pre-determined, binary formats by supported type. When reading, Arrow memory maps data from arrow memory. This means the OS gives access to memory which is swapped into RAM upon requests. &#40;Jacob Quinn – correspondence on Apache Arrow mailing list&#41;</p>

<p>Today, I spent some time learning about DrWatson.jl. I have always wanted to use the project and now I finally have a reason to work with it&#33; I enjoyed the default layout provided by DrWatson - here are some general thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>The project directory provided by DrWatson is automatically setup. The defaults are quite nice and I did not change anything except for ignoring the data files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">│projectdir          &lt;- Project&#39;s main folder. It is initialized as a Git
│                       repository with a reasonable .gitignore file.
│
├── _research        &lt;- WIP scripts, code, notes, comments,
│   |                   to-dos and anything in an alpha state.
│   └── tmp          &lt;- Temporary data folder.
│
├── data             &lt;- **Immutable and add-only&#33;**
│   ├── sims         &lt;- Data resulting directly from simulations.
│   ├── exp_pro      &lt;- Data from processing experiments.
│   └── exp_raw      &lt;- Raw experimental data.
│
├── plots            &lt;- Self-explanatory.
├── notebooks        &lt;- Jupyter, Weave or any other mixed media notebooks.
│
├── papers           &lt;- Scientific papers resulting from the project.
│
├── scripts          &lt;- Various scripts, e.g. simulations, plotting, analysis,
│   │                   The scripts use the &#96;src&#96; folder for their base code.
│   └── intro.jl     &lt;- Simple file that uses DrWatson and uses its greeting.
│
├── src              &lt;- Source code for use in this project. Contains functions,
│                       structures and modules that are used throughout
│                       the project and in multiple scripts.
│
├── README.md        &lt;- Optional top-level README for anyone using this project.
├── .gitignore       &lt;- by default ignores _research, data, plots, videos,
│                       notebooks and latex-compilation related files.
│
├── Manifest.toml    &lt;- Contains full list of exact package versions used currently.
└── Project.toml     &lt;- Main project file, allows activation and installation.
                        Includes DrWatson by default.</code></pre>
<p>I started DrWatson up in my Julia REPL and ran the following as I already had a git repo set-up and files in the repo:</p>

initialize_project&#40;&quot;NeuriViz&quot;; authors &#61; &#91;&quot;Jacob Zelko&quot;, &quot;Zachary P Christensen&quot;&#93;, force &#61; false, git &#61; false, placeholder &#61; true&#41;</code></pre>
<p>It set up the structure I needed and was quite easy to use. DrWatson was created by George Datseris.</p>

<h3 id="what_is_satisfaction">What is Satisfaction?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m thirty-four years old, I oughta be makin&#39; my future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s when I come running home.  And now, I get here, and I don&#39;t know what to do with myself.  &#91;After a pause&#93; I&#39;ve always made a point of not wasting my life, and everytime I come back here I know that all I&#39;ve done is to waste my life.&quot; </p>
<p><em>Biff talking to his mother about his life&#39;s relative miserable existence</em></p>
<p>His obsession for not wasting his life or waiting almost for his life to start is similar to my thoughts. Interesting. I think the big thing is here is the overinflated notion of being &quot;big&quot; or important.  As though that were the ultimate goal of any man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All I can do now is wait for the merchandise manager to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And suppose I get to be merchandise manager?  He&#39;s a good friend of mine, and he just built a terrific estate on Long Island.  And he lived there about two months and sold it, and now he&#39;s building another one.  He can&#39;t enjoy it once it&#39;s finished.  And I know that&#39;s just what I would do.  I don&#39;t know what the hell I&#39;m workin&#39; for.  Sometimes I sit in my apartment—all alone.  And I think of the rent I&#39;m paying.  And it&#39;s crazy.  But then, it&#39;s what I always wanted.  My own apartment, a car, and plenty of women.  And still, goddammit, I&#39;m lonely.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Happy talking to his brother, Biff, about his own struggle and situation in life</em></p>
<p>This carries on the theme of the dissatisfaction with the attainment of being &quot;big&quot;. Happy got everything he could want but is still unhappy – contrasting this with Biff is that Biff is unhappy even though he did not get what he wanted.  These are two examples of being dissatisfied in uniquely different ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linda: &quot;&#91;to Willy ...&#93; Why must everybody conquer the world?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a powerful insight into Linda&#39;s thinking.  To Linda, Willy already has the best things in the world. He just can&#39;t stop to realize it or rather, it is not enough for him to have a loving family. He needs to be big in the eyes of &quot;people&quot;.  This reminds me of my note on <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07132020022756-media-timothy.md">&quot;False Expertise&quot;</a> where there, the problem is that being exposed enough to material gives you prestige. In this case, Willy thinks being acknowledged by people as a nice guy is enough to ensure endless success.</p>
<h3 id="shattering_of_innocence">Shattering of Innocence</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy: &quot;Never mind&#33;  He&#39;s going to give you those points.  I&#39;ll see to it.&quot; Biff: &quot;He wouldn&#39;t listen to you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The crushing moment when Biff sees through his father and loses complete faith in him.</em></p>
<p>I find this moment in the story more tragic than Willy&#39;s eventual death. It is this moment which doomed Willy and his family for the rest of his life.  It&#39;s never explained why Willy had an affair but, perhaps, that is the point.  A person does not need a reason for slipping.  I find it interesting how Willy tries to keep up the front of being an exemplar amongst men. Though Biff later calls his father, &quot;a prince among men,&quot; I believe it was to keep up Willy&#39;s pretense. I wonder if Willy did confess this incident to his family, if things may have been different...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all the highways, and the trains, and the appointments, and the years, you end up worth more dead than alive.&quot;</p>
<p>The moment in which Willy realizes his life is not moving towards any grand destiny and decides fully upon suicide. It&#39;s an interesting insight about the idea of providing incentives.</p>
<h3 id="false_expectations">False Expectations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Willy: &quot;Without a penny to &#91;my brother&#39;s name&#93;, &#91;...&#93; it&#39;s not what you do&#91;.&#93;  It&#39;s who you know and the smile on your face&#33;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crux of Willy&#39;s mentality on how life &quot;should be&quot; and how he expects life to work. Ultimately, this is proven false when he fails to get a job after pulling his contacts. In reality, nearly the exact opposite of this maxim is the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charley: &quot;The only thing you got in this world is what you can sell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the funny thing is that you&#39;re a salesman, and you don&#39;t know that.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Willy&#39;s neighbor Charley admonishing him on his frustration with the world not working they way Willy expects it to.</em></p>
<p>Ultimately, this searing criticism of Willy shows to him that he doesn&#39;t have any skills to offer outside of his perfunctory service as a salesman. He is a mediocre man who never tried to adapt and move with the times. And Willy refuses to believe that life passed him by in that way.</p>

<h3 id="quotes_regarding_knowledge">Quotes Regarding Knowledge</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are known knowns; there are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns; that is to say, there are things that we now know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns — there are things we do not know we don’t know.&quot; - Secretary of State, Donald Rumsfeld</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot; - Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An inductive approach to knowledge that Sherlock Holmes takes to solve puzzles and problems.</p>

<p>&quot;Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book&quot; - Oscar Wilde, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04202022021854-picture-dorian-gray.md">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote gets at how the influence of a book can corrupt an individual or push someone further to corruption. In Gray&#39;s case, he was already corrupted but the book further pushed him beyond what evil he was already capable of pursuing.</p>
<h3 id="quotes_regarding_fame">Quotes Regarding Fame</h3>

<p>&quot;For there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot; - Oscar Wilde, <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04202022021854-picture-dorian-gray.md">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you attain fame, at least you are talked about – whether positively or negatively. But to not be talked about means no one even knows who you are.</p>

<p>The central hypotheses of this paper are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>IDD persons have higher prevalence of conditions associated with higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outcomes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Case-fatality rate would be higher for COVID19 individuals with IDD than without IDD.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="data_methods">Data Methods</h3>
<p>COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a COVID-19 diagnosis code or a positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test result since January 20, 2020. Patients were categorized as those with and without diagnosed developmental disability, including intellectual disability &#40;F70-79&#41;, cerebral palsy &#40;G80&#41;, Down syndrome &#40;Q90&#41;, and other developmental disabilities &#40;F80-89, Q91-99&#41;.</p>
<p>Documentation was provided for comorbidities related to risk for severe outcomes with COVID-19 up to the date of the first COVID-19 documentation. Trends in number of cases, number of deaths, and case-fatality rates were compared between COVID19 patients with IDD and without IDD. Age distributions for number of cases and number of deaths were computed for both patient groups. Deaths occurring within 30 days of the date of first COVID-19 documentation in the EMR were identified and used to calculate case-fatality rates and 95&#37; confidence intervals. Age groups were selected based upon the knowledge that COVID-19 rates are substantially lower among children, &#91;1&#93; and that a disproportionately lower percent of adults with IDD live into older age. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>We excluded patients with diagnosis codes of other specified viral infection &#40;ICD-9 code: 097.89&#41; or suspected exposure to other biologic agents &#40;ICD-10 code: Z03.818&#41; during the same timeframe</p>

<p>S. D. Landes, M. A. Turk, M. K. Formica, K. E. McDonald, and J. D. Stevens, &quot;COVID-19 outcomes among people with intellectual and developmental disability living in residential group homes in New York State,&quot; Disability and Health Journal, p. 100969, Jun. 2020, doi: 10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.100969.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> COVID-19 case rates, case fatality, and mortality rates will be elevated for IDD persons abiding in residential group homes.</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>They assume the majority of cases reported in this study are likely for symptomatic individuals.</p>
<p>Residential group home data are from New York Disability Advocates. Homes typically have 7 residents, but range from between 4 and 14 residents. All residents are age 18 and over. NYDA data includes: number of residents, COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, and COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p>Residential group homes are required to complete a COVID-19 screen and temperature check at least once per day in homes that have not had a prior confirmed case. For a prior confirmed case, screening and checks once per shift. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>IDD individuals experience health disparities and high prevalence of comorbidities. &#91;2&#93; Many of which areassociated with more severe COVID19 outcomes. &#91;3&#93;, &#91;4&#93; There is a paucity of IDD health research. &#91;5&#93;, &#91;6&#93; Furthermore, the CDC only issued COVID-19 guidance relevant to this population in late May. <em>RQ: That&#39;s absurd how long it took the CDC to issue guidelines about this population. I wonder if WHO has issued any guidelines related to individuals with IDD?</em></p>
<p>There may be increased risk from COVID-19 for individuals living in congregate care settings due to difficulty in maintaining physical distancing. &#91;7&#93;–&#91;9&#93; It is estimated that 13&#37; of IDD adults reside in congregate care settings, &#91;10&#93; with shared use of essential living spaces, closeproximity to others, high levels of personal care assistancefrom staff, and multiple shift staffing patterns. &#91;11&#93;  <em>RQ: It seems like the authors are insinuating that individauls with IDD are at increased risk for COVID19 due to group care facilities.  Not so much biologic dysfunction. However, I think they say later there is biologic concern.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The journal medical hypothesis lacks a standard peer review process, but is often utilized to posit ideas quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Purpose of paper:</strong> consolidate data to support the hypothesis of ASD being a risk for COVID19 like other risks.</p>
<p>Involves several modifications at the genetic and at the immune level &#40;e.g. increases of inflammatorycytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels&#41;. &#91;1&#93; Some are conditions considered risk-factor of symptomatic COVID-19 and its mortality.</p>
<h3 id="cytokine_observations_in_asd_and_covid19">Cytokine Observations in ASD and COVID19</h3>
<p>Initially there is an endogenous immune response in the presence of COVID19. The response is linked to the destruction level of the virus, the patient’s innateresponse, and it determines its inflammation status and symptomatology. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Secretory increases of ACE-2 was correlated with COVID-19 patients &#91;3&#93;. There seem to exist an ACE-2 superexpression leading to a pro-inflammatory state, related to cardiac and pulmonary damage &#91;3&#93; ACE-2 is a regulator in angiotensin-2transformation into angiotensin-&#40;1-7&#41; metabolite. It has inflammatory effects producing vasodilatation, anti-proliferation and apoptosis. This is common to CVD conditions &#91;4&#93;.</p>
<p>Coronavirus also has the characteristic of being neuroinvasive. &#91;5&#93; This characteristic shows via:- Febrile seizures - Encephalitis - Convulsions - Change in mental status Some neurological symptomsfound in COVID-19 patients are non-specific, such as headache, dizziness and confusion. Neurological symptoms were directly related to patients. &#91;6&#93; Thereby, we can hypothesize that its physiopathology might have a strict relation with the nervous system.</p>

<p><strong>Indirect self-harm</strong> &#40;ISH&#41; are non-suicidal actions that individuals take to physically mistreat or abuse themselves. It does not immediately lead to direct bodily damage &#91;1&#93;. Examples of ISH are eating disorders, remaining in physically abusive relationships, extended abuse of substances, and flippant behavior &#91;1&#93;.</p>
<p>Indirect self-harm &#40;ISH&#41; is conceptually different from <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07122020185239-direct-self-harm.md">direct self-harm</a> &#40;DSH&#41;. Generally, ISH is an expression of centering oneself. It is a way to control one&#39;s feelings or to exact punishment. &#91;2&#93; As such, ISH can be a coping mechanism to handle emotional anguish, rage and frustration. &#91;1&#93; Some use it as a means to lower tension &#91;3&#93;.</p>
<p>Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses. &#91;4&#93; For women aged 15-24, mortality rates related to Anorexia are 12 times greater than other mortality rates. &#91;5&#93; As such, the eating disorder community is generally the most prolific indirect self-harm community. A majority of the literature about  indirect self-harm literature is centered around it &#91;6&#93;–&#91;9&#93;</p>

<p>Direct self-harm is defined as the deliberate, direct destruction or alteration of body tissue without conscious suicidal intent, but resulting in injury severe enough for tissue damage to occur &#91;1&#93;. </p>
<p>Examples are of Direct Self Harm are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cutting, burning, scratching, and hitting of oneself &#91;2&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Skin bleaching &#91;3&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hair-pulling &#91;4&#93;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ingesting hazardous chemicals &#91;5&#93;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The term &quot;direct self-harm&quot; is often used interchangeably with the terms self-injury &#91;6&#93;, self-mutilation &#91;7&#93;, and self-wounding &#91;8&#93;. Despite the exact wording, the distinction of direct self-harm is that it is non-suicidal but does cause direct injury to the body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work — which is by faith. The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk. They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>1 Timothy 1:3 - 7</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was reading this passage in 1 Timothy and was thinking about how it very much relates to one of the current issues being faced in the world. Social media&#39;s negative impact on individuals. Particularly the parallels drawn between Paul&#39;s letter and today are very much talking about the same thing. People being drawn away to nonsensical things that are not useful to life. Or, worse, becoming supposed &quot;experts&quot; in fields that they truly know nothing about but have heard enough <em>things</em> to give them the impression of having learned something.</p>
<p>And Paul very explicitly calls these people out by saying they do not know anything. Furthermore, Paul states how these sort of meaningless discussions only promote controversial speculations rather than actually pushing us forward to a meaningful goal. This is very much a problem being faced in today&#39;s society where social media is being used to promote narratives or stories as a means of information but in reality, does not deliver on anything. Furthermore, the polarization that comes from such negative discussion is almost exactly the same as Paul is describing. The only real difference may be how this is impacting so many more individuals than in the past, but the same problems persist: polarization, false impressions of expertise, and endless arguments or quabbling. </p>

<p>Based on the results, taking rest is best for maintaining vigilance. A different perspective can proffer an explanation for this: </p>
<p>Differing tasks which interrupt one during a vigilance task may both utilize distinctly unique resources and require different amounts of resources. The tasks may have elicited different levels of cognitive load.</p>
<p>There exist on-going debate about the origins of vigilance decrement &#91;1&#93;. The best known is based on resource theory. However critics think it is a circular mode of reasoning &#91;2&#93;.</p>
<p>Current findings suggest that vigilance decrement comes from repeated use of executive resources. There may be domain specific interference when the primary task and activities during a break make use of the same resources.</p>
<p>The findings by Ariga do not support the idea that vigilance decrement is due to task under-load. &#91;3&#93; Knowing why resting can assist with refocusing is difficult. Perhaps, rest allowed participants to engage in day dreaming which eliminated task monotony. </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The use of anarchy as a philosophical approach to learning anything.</p>

<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>P. Feyerabend, <em>Against method</em>, 3rd ed. London ; New York: Verso, 1993.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>General Themes</li><li>Limits of Current Education</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<h3 id="general_themes">General Themes</h3>
<p>The goal of Against Method is to show that all methodologies have limits.</p>
<p>&quot;Passion&quot;, in Kierkegaard&#39;s sense, should encourage playful exploration of ideas. This passion results in behavior that facilitates circumstances and ideas which can produce a logical framework regarding an idea. &#91;1&#93;  Feyerabend contends that people rely on too narrow and fixed frameworks to understand the world. Only one principle that guides learning under any circumstance of human development is the principle &quot;anything goes.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_His central thesis somewhat reminds me of the teaching about everything being permissible but not everything being beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder how the two can be related fully._</p>
<p>Knowledge according to Feyerabend is not a harmonious convergence towards an ideal. Rather, it is an ocean of alternatives that forces ideas into succinct articulation. Each idea competitively contributes to the development of consciousness. This makes a lot of sense. Rather than ideas being fixed in the mind, they are ever open to change and influence. Unanimity of opinion works for tyranny contends Feyerabend. Variety however is needed for objective knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy Principle:</strong> facts exist and are independent of whether one considers alternatives to the theory to be tested.</p>
<p><strong>Theoretical numerical disagreement:</strong> A theory determines a predicted value. What is obtained in reality differs from the prediction.</p>
<h3 id="limits_of_current_education">Limits of Current Education</h3>
<p>Scientific education has the aim of making concepts more accessible at the cost of strict and unchangeable rules.  An essential part of training inhibits intuitions that might lead to a blurring of boundaries. It does this by simplifying its participants in the following manner:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A domain of research is defined.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The domain is separated from the rest of history.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>This domain is then given a &#39;logic&#39; of its own.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Training in such &#39;logic&#39; then conditions the domain&#39;s disciples.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It makes their actions more uniform and it freezes large parts of the historical process as well.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Stable &#39;facts&#39;  independent of opinion, belief, and cultural background arise and persevere despite the vicissitudes of</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>history.</p>
<p>Makes me think of Godel&#39;s principle that there is a limit to what can be proved within a given domain given the tools of that domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relevant Quote:  &quot;A person&#39;s religion, for example, or his metaphysics, or his sense of humour must not have the slightest connection with his scientific activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His imagination is restrained, and even his language ceases to be his own.&quot;</p>
<p>The <strong>consistency condition</strong> of modern academia demands new hypotheses to agree with accepted theories. It preserves the older theory but not the better theory. Theories should only be changed when a theory disagrees with facts. Discussion of incompatible facts will lead to progress. Discussion of incompatible hypotheses will not.</p>

<p>The false idea that repetition improves memory traces back to the mid-1960&#39;s. Psychologist Endel Tulving, from the University of Toronto, tested people on their ability to remember lists of common English nouns.</p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>Feedback has been extensively studied. &#91;1&#93; It can lead to the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strengthen effects of testing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be of greater benefit if it&#39;s slightly delayed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enhance positive and reduces the negative effects of multiple choice testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Frequent immediate feedback can be detrimental to long-term learning for motor skills at it provides a crutch during practice that isn&#39;t present during the test. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<h3 id="effects_of_quizzing">Effects of Quizzing</h3>
<p>Quizzing produced a significant improvement relative to no quizzing or directed review of target concepts on unit exams and on cumulative semester and end-of-year exams. A well-placed review quiz produced benefits on the exams that were as robust as several repeated quizzes in some cases.</p>
<p>This phenomenon was first researched at Columbia Middle School. &#91;3&#93;, &#91;4&#93; They reported well-controlled experiments on the benefits of quizzing for middle school students&#39; performances on classroom exams in social studies and science.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics_of_learning">Characteristics of Learning</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Learning needs memory</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning is a lifelong endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning is an acquired skill; often counterintuitive.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a roadmap for the skill you want to learn. Determine how best to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimize your situation to make learning and concentrating, easy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Feedback is not fun but use it and don&#39;t let your ego cloud useful insights.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know why and what you forget. Begin to remember information for long-term benefit.</p>

<li><p>Build a thorough understanding of concepts via experimenting or playing with new ideas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="make_a_roadmap_for_a_learning_project">Make a Roadmap for a Learning Project</h3>
<p>You should invest ~10 percent of your expected learning time into research prior to starting a project.</p>
<h4 id="what_is_the_project_and_what_does_it_entail">What Is the Project and What Does It Entail?</h4>
<p>When asking the question of &quot;What&quot; regarding a learning project, break the knowledge of a subject into &quot;Concepts,&quot; &quot;Facts,&quot; and &quot;Procedures.&quot; This enables the understanding of concepts to be understood in flexible ways. Thankfully, when breaking done this information, facts generally only need to be memorized but a deep understanding may not be not required. In the same vein, procedures are actions that need to be performed and do not involve much conscious thinking.</p>
<h4 id="how_do_we_approach_the_project">How Do We Approach The Project?</h4>
<p>Employing the <strong>Emphasize/Exclude Method</strong> is to find areas of study that align with identified goals. Part of this method is to omit or delay from your curriculum material which do not align with your goals. Familiarize yourself with what is common for <strong>benchmarking</strong>, or the ways people learn a skill or subject, regarding your project.</p>
<p><strong>Directness:</strong> learning being directly related to the way you want to use the information.</p>

<p>Poverty of material conditions alone does not explain a biological explanation for causes of impaired lifespans.</p>
<p>It is historically noted that there is a general shortage of randomized control trials to determine the utility of interventions in all areas of public health. DIscussion about the lack of controlled trials in public health pertaining to the social determinants area and the field of public health in general.</p>
<p>James Lind is rightly acknowledged as an exceptional public health figure because as early as the 18th century he conducted controlled investigations to show citrus fruit cured scurvy. By contrast, John Snow’s determination in the 19th century that ingestion of contaminated water led to cholera, relied on careful observation and the exercise of reasoned judgement rather than his uncontrolled experiment of removing the handle of the Broad Street pump.</p>
<p>When approaching the area of social determinants, risk factors were first separated from behaviours and biological markers.</p>
<p>Causes of the causes can be thought of as the underlying issues that give rise or is directly related to a given issue. </p>
<p>Second method of approach by Marmot to examine the social determinants of health. To give an example: &quot;It is not an accident that people consume diets high in saturated fat and salt. It represents the nature of the food supply, culture, affordability, and availability, among other influences.&quot;</p>
<p>The psychosocial understanding of the social determinants of health emphasizes experiential personal accounts. Negative accounts which induce acute and chronic stress affect human biology. This ultimately leads to impairment of physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The social gradient of health goes from the high echelons of society to those living in dire conditions. Each step down this hierarchy also lowers standards of health.</p>
<h3 id="the_fallacy_of_diseases_of_the_rich_and_poor">The Fallacy of Diseases of the Rich and Poor</h3>
<p>There existed the notion that there were diseases of the rich and of the poor. Mortality rate reflected this belief. However, this was false.</p>
<p>The impoverished are not the only ones to anguish. An example being that despite civil servants being economically well-off, it was found there was an inverse relationship between employment grade and risk for causes of death.</p>
<p>Stress does not only affect senior managers or others in positions of great public responsibility. High effort linked to high reward is generally health promoting. &#91;1&#93; Poor health is seen where there is limited, real or perceived, control over a situation with a small chance of reward where the situation is psychologically demanding during an extended period of time. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that infectionand immunity may also be important in two poorly recognized ways </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A contributory cause of diseases not previously considered to be due to infection</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chronic stress may alter susceptibility to infection and its severity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the_fight_or_flight_response_and_its_role_in_disease">The Fight Or Flight Response and Its Role in Disease</h3>
<p>The fight or flight response is brief and rather unusual for animals. The response can be vital for an animal&#39;s survival. For humans, emergencies are comparatively rare. However, for people, regular psychological demands and challenges may activate the fight or flight response too often. </p>
<p>Fight-or-flight adapts well to acute stress but may not to chronic stress in today’s urban environment. &#91;4&#93;</p>
<p>Prolonged elevated cortisol amounts can manifest paranoia or depression.</p>
<h4 id="sympatho-adrenal_pathway">Sympatho-Adrenal Pathway</h4>
<p><img src="07132020192025-heart-adrenaline.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Heart rate is directly impacted by sympathetic nerve impulses. It is indirectly affected by circulating adrenaline level.</p>
<p>Increased &quot;stickiness&quot; in platelets occurs due to increases in adrenaline in the blood. Blood tends to become more concentrated and viscous at the same time. Stress-related hormones can increase the output of fibrinogen from the liver. This may add to formation of arterial plaques and increased risks of heart disease and stroke &#91;5&#93;, &#91;6&#93;</p>
<p>The sympatho-adrenal pathway activates, prepares for, or maintains physical exertion. It causes psychological arousal and energy mobilization. It inhibits functions irrelevant to immediatesurvival. Degree of activation depends on stressorand its duration. Thesympatho-adrenal pathway can be switched off rapidly.</p>
<p>The first pathway is the sympatho-adrenal pathway and activates quickly. It consists of the sympathetic branch of the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/12302020174059-autonomic-nervous-system.md">autonomic nervous system</a>. The pathway produces two hormones:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Noradrenaline at nerve endings</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adrenaline directly into the bloodstream by the medulla &#40;or middle part&#41; of the adrenal glands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This produces the sensation of our stomach tightening when being exposed to sudden shock.</p>
<h4 id="hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal_hpa_axis">Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; Axis</h4>
<p><img src="07132020192442-hpa-axis.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure from Chapter 2 of &#91;7&#93;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; Axis operates over minutes and hours. Its key components are the three corresponding hormone secreting glands. The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal &#40;HPA&#41; axis is the slower, seconday response to stress. It results in cortisol release into the bloodstream from adrenal glands. The dotted lines show feedback controls which regulate release of cortisol and other corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex.</p>
<h4 id="effects">Effects</h4>
<p>Circulating adrenaline and sympathetic nerve activity generated during the Fight or Flight response:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Accelerate heart rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase metabolic rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase blood pressure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase sensory vigilance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increase sweat secretion</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate pupils</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate airways</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dilate blood vessels in skeletal muscles</p>
</li>
<li><p>Constrict blood vessels in skin and gut</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inhibit salivation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Glucocorticoid hormones, like cortisol, have metabolic and psychological effects. These hormones are vital to upkeep and regulation of resting and stress-related metabolic functions. </p>
<p>In emergency situations, glucocorticoid hormones are antagonistic to the insulin hormone, resulting in the mobilization of energy reserves via elevation of blood glucose and fatty acid release from fat tissues. This is very desirable in emergencies. </p>
<p>However, in non-emergencies, unneeded energy that can be released tends to increase output into the blood of cholesterol-carrying particles from the liver.</p>
<h4 id="overall_response_to_stress">Overall Response to Stress</h4>
<p><img src="07132020191448-stress-baselines.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Shown are idealized representations of neuroendocrine and metabolic activity in the presence of stress. &#40; a &#41; depicts rapid baseline recovery as responsive and flexible &#40; b &#41; illustrates a slow recovery but an eventual delayed return to baseline &#40; c &#41; shows a weak reaction with an elevated baseline alongside a small response.</p>
<p>If a stress response is activated too regularly, feedback controls within the neuroendocrine system could reset one&#39;s baseline to a new elevated and potentially health-damaging level driven by environmental factors &#91;8&#93;, &#91;9&#93;</p>

<p>How the brain, HPA axis, and immunesystem communicate with one another. The brain perceives cognitive stimuli. This perception can influence immune function via neuropeptides, the ANS, and the HPA axis. The immune system responds to non-cognitive stimuli. Examples of non-cognitive stimuli are infection and tumour growth. Cytokines and peptidehormones are secreted which affect the brain and neuroendocrine system. <em>RQ: ASD dysregulation of cytokines are directly impacted by the interference COVID19 thus further complicating response in the HPA axis.</em></p>
<h4 id="social_effects_on_well-being">Social Effects on Well-Being</h4>
<p><img src="07132020184157-well-being-impacts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Further, the balance of influences on health depends on geographical location and historical circumstances of the population in question.</p>
<p>This generalized diagram includes circumstances beyond individual control as well as personal situations. From the top left to the bottom right, there is a clear chain of influence between social structure and well-being.</p>
<p>Given the correct information, a similar pictogram could be made for each category of disease.</p>
<p>Current thoughts about everything which can impact overall well-being.</p>
<p>The social and cultural environment and organization of work are current factors in consideration in public policy. Psychological and biological factors are latent causes of disease. These tend to be the main focus of medical attention. In reality, these factors are intermediates on the pathway from social position to an individual&#39;s state of health. &#91;10&#93;</p>
<p>Social structure affects an individual via three primary influences:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Material circumstances are related to health directly through one&#39;s social and work environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Material circumstances then impacts psychological factors and health-related behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Early life experiences, cultural, and genetic factors also exert influences on health.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One example is a study of children at orphanages:</p>
<p>Under the same food conditions, children in the ‘Bienenhaus&#39; orphanage under the control of a stern Fraülein Schwarz, gained less weight and grew slowly. This opposite to children under the care of the affectionate Fraülein Grün at the ‘Vogelnest&#39; orphanage.  Schwarz replaced Grün during the study at ‘Vogelnest&#39; and growth rates were subsequently reversed. This controlled cross-over study provides evidence that adverse psychosocial circumstances in childhood can influence growth. &#91;11&#93;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be careful about conflating correlation with causation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been closely examining the Hypothalamus Pituitary &#40;HPA&#41; axis and have seen how cytokines directly interact with it. &#91;1&#93; Therefore, since ASD has been correlated with cytokine dysregulation &#91;2&#93;, it can be reasonable to suspect that as coronavirae can also impact cytokine regulation &#91;3&#93;, ASD is a risk factor for COVID19 causing direct problems with the HPA axis leading to multiple downstream issues.</p>
<p>ASD has been correlated with abnormal immune function. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Cytokine dysregulation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inflammation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Presence of autoantibodies</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Studies show the presence of anti-brain immunoglobulins in ASD patients. &#91;4&#93; ASD status could also be directly correlated with patients’ cytokine and chemokine levels which cause organ inflammation &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>There is a second phase resulting in a cytokine storm which particularly affects respiratory epithelium &#91;5&#93;. The storm activates cytokines IL-1-beta, IL-6 and TNFalfa. These activations aggravate respiratory symptoms. These cytokines cause damage to pulmonary microvasculature. It simultaneously affects apoptosis and chemotaxis resulting in decreases of epithelial barriers and alveolar edema <em>Back up references about cytokines</em></p>

<p>This paper aims to define what digital self-harm is.</p>
<p>Digital self harm: online communication and activity that leads to, supports, or exacerbates non-suicidal yet intentional harm or impairment of an individual’s physical wellbeing.  It includes consuming and generating online content.  Digital self-harm occurs when a person’s behaviors are negatively influenced through his or her online activities in such a manner that these online activities lead to the infliction of non-suicidal direct or indirect physical harm to oneself. </p>
<p>Traditionally, eating disorder treatments generally include individual and family therapy or group therapy. Interpersonal and cultural forces that sustain self-harm activities are scrutinized.</p>
<p>As a field, CSCW and HCI health research appears to unconsciously emphasize the positive health benefits of technology &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93;.  This unaddressed bias can have great consequences on platform design and policy and must be scrutinized.</p>
<p>Digital self-harm is believed to be growing at a rate that will not stop without check. &#91;4&#93;</p>
<h3 id="examples_of_digital_self-harm">Examples of Digital Self-Harm</h3>
<p>Pro-anorexic digital self-harm example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT, GO ON A DIET FATTY.  ONE IS EITHER ANA/MIA OR NOT. IT IS A GIFT AND YOU CANNOT DECIDE TO HAVE AN EATING DISORDER. SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT, S-S-S-S-SORRY JUNIOR&#33;&#33; MOVE ON, TRY JENNY CRAIG</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two different ways the language around cutting is used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normalizing behavior: attempts in legitimizing activities to deal with mental health issues</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pathologizing behavior: focuses on a bodily disgust with the behavior being wrong morally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems_with_the_internet">Problems with the Internet</h3>
<p>The internet creates an environment for reinforced strengthening of behavioral issues within an affected individual through encouragement of destructive behaviors. This sort of cybernetic reinforcement mechanism could lead to the fast and serious manifestations of underlying disease symptoms.</p>
<p>ED websites may have contagion-like effects on individuals investigating eating disorders prior to exhibiting any commitment to a disorder. &#91;5&#93; Regarding adolescents, a concern is a healthy desire for weight-loss could lead to unintended exposure of ED content.</p>
<p><em>QUESTION: I wonder if there is a corollary definition about unintentional digital self-harm? People who are not necessarily interested in self-harm, but come into it anyways.</em></p>

<p>In 2014, WHO found that 20&#37; of children aged 15 confirmed having self-harmed within the last year. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Self-harm is a mental illness that results in causing pain or harm to oneself. &#91;2&#93; Examples include restrictive and binge eating, cutting, hitting, scratching, burning, bleaching of an individual’s body, and other forms of self-mutilation. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Self-harm generally pertains to non-life threatening actions individuals perform to negatively impact their health. This starts with actions like cutting and wrist slashing. &#91;4&#93; It can then lead to more severe acts of injuring human body tissue &#91;5&#93; and to <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07122020174529-indirect-self-harm.md">indirect self-harming behavior</a> such as eating disorders &#91;6&#93;</p>
<p>There are many types of self-harming behavior such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07122020174529-indirect-self-harm.md">Indirect Self-Harm</a></p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Further complicating discrete categories is that not all people that self-harm are <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/07122020192840-suicide.md">suicidal</a>. &#91;7&#93;</p>

<h3 id="history_of_virus">History of Virus</h3>
<p>Coronavirus disease was discovered in 1931 and the first human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, was isolated in 1965. &#91;1&#93; Since then, three main groups of coronavirus have been identified. The following grouping only accounts for types affecting humans &#91;2&#93;:</p>
<p>Group 1: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 Group 2: HCoVOC43, HCoV-HKU1 Group 3: No human CoVs found</p>
<h3 id="clinical_picture">Clinical Picture</h3>
<p>All human coronaviruses have been reported worldwide. Infections occur throughout the year though most frequently in winter and spring. Larger outbreaks tend to occur every 2 - 4 years. &#91;2&#93; One is often infected with coronavirus early in life. Being infected with one strain does not yield protection against others. Immunity to the same virus does not last long. Reinfection can occur within a few months. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Coronavirae are a common cause of the cold, causing about 2–10&#37; infections across the world. Infections in adults usually experience symptoms of rhinitis, sore throat and sometimes coughing. Asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic lung disease sufferers may experience a worsening of underlying illness from coronavirus. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Coronavirus is acquired via air-borne particles &#40;fecal matter, droplets, etc.&#41; upon inhalation by an individual. The coronavirus enters the respiratory system. From there, it multiplies in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. It then spreads to the lower respiratory tract. &#91;2&#93;</p>

<p>SARS-CoV does not act like the other coronaviruses. It&#39;s classification is debated by researchers but some put it in group 2. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Phase I of initial showing of SARS-CoV symptoms &#91;1&#93;:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Fever &gt; 38°C</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rigors</p>
</li>
<li><p>Myalgia</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sore throat</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gastrointestinal symptoms</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Phase 2 &#40;3 - 7 days after initial symptoms&#41; Characterized by cough and shortness of breath. Hypoxia can develop in individuals and relative lymphopenia and neutropenia is possible. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Some patients showed a biphasic course, with apparent recovery followed by worsening of the clinical condition. Mortality was highest in the elderly and lowest in the younger population, and co-existing illness worsened morbidity and mortality. Upwards of 10 - 20&#37; of cases needed ventilation. &#91;1&#93;</p>

<p>There are a few <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05132020135855-linear-vectors.md">definitions of a vector</a>. For this overview, I will use the definition that a vector is that which has the algebra of a vector space. The operations for vectors are straight-forward:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Vector Addition</p>
</li>
</ol>
\[
v + w = \begin{bmatrix} v_{1}\\ v_{2} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} w_{1}\\ w_{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_{1} + w_{1}\\ v_{2} + w_{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Scalar Multiplication</p>
</li>
</ol>
\[
2v = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
2v_{1} \\
2v_{2} \\
\end{array}
\right]

<h3 id="issues_regarding_the_adoption_of_the_spacing_effect_into_classroom_settings">Issues regarding the adoption of the spacing effect into classroom settings.</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The spacing effect has not been studied in recent years</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect is still relatively new</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect does not have any thing to do with current issues educators face.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect has yet to be shown well in school activities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are gaps in literature about the spacing effect</p>
</li>
<li><p>School-based studies do not show the spacing effect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect has not been well demonstrated in a classroom setting</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not enough is known about practical class implementation to warrant application of the spacing effect</p>
</li>
<li><p>The spacing effect is not well comprehended</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most concerning issues concerning usage of the spacing effect:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ahistorical character of research on the spacing effect</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some failures to obtain the effect with school-like activities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paucity of impressive classroom demonstrations of the phenomenon</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limited knowledge of classroom practice</p>
</li>
<li><p>Incomplete understanding of the psychological bases of the spacing effect</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Probably the most legitimate barrier to utilization of the spacing effect in educational settings is the scarcity of in class demonstrations of its usage.</strong></p>
<p>However, these four issues are not considered as such strong impediments to the implementation of the spacing effect in classroom settings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is not new and has been studied</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continues to receive recent documentation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can assist in addressing educational issues</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is demonstrated to lend itself well to school-like activities</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="miscellaneous_concepts">Miscellaneous Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Lag effects</strong> are believed to occur when performance on a memory task improves as the number of intervening items between successive presentations increases.</p>
<p><strong>Jost&#39;s Law:</strong> If two memories are equal in how well they were learned but at differing times, the older memory will gain more out of a review than the new one. &#91;1&#93;</p>

<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Mindlessness theory:</strong> vigilance decrement is due to gross inattention or mindlessness. During monotonous vigilance tasks, supervisory attentional systems lose their effectiveness and observers perform the task in a thoughtless manner. Essentially, zoning during a task such as driving a regular path to work or making a bed. &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Vigilance tasks often show a negative sloping curve as a function of time. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Vigilance decrement does not concern depletion of attention resources. It is about a loss of control over our thoughts.</p>
<p>Heightened levels of vigilance can be maintained over prolonged periods of time with the use of infrequent, controlled breaks from a particular vigilance task. &#91;4&#93;</p>
<p>Ariga proposes that with respect to cognitive control, vigilance decrement may have difficulties due to goal habituation. Ariga argues thatgoals which draw on cognitive faculties should show effects similar to habituation.</p>
<p>Arriga argues that vigilance decrements ought be observed for any task that is performed continuously if goal habituation happens.  It should not depend necessarily on the extent to which the task can be routinized</p>
<p><strong>Task-Unrelated-Thoughts:</strong> when we subconsciously disengage from a task and start thinking about other related subjects</p>
<p>How Ariga believes vigilance decrement should be viewed. Cognitive control is also known as executive control. &#91;5&#93;, &#91;6&#93; Ariga&#39;s posits vigilance decrement is a failure of cognitive control. This is in contrast to the current thought that vigilance decrement is the inability to recover resources needed for retention as a function of time.</p>
<p>The defintion of habituation </p>
<p><strong>Habituation effect:</strong> the gradual diminishing of representation to sustained stimulation. Can occur even when being actively involved in tasks that require cognitive effort &#91;7&#93;, &#91;8&#93; and in tasks regarding meaning &#91;9&#93; This links back to how Ariga views vigilance decrement.</p>

<p>The spacing effect accounts for the fact that learning is improved when studying is spread out over time. It was first discovered and described by Hermann Ebbinghaus during 1880 - 1885. &#91;1&#93; His findings were later accurately reproduced and documented by <em>Murre &amp; Dros</em>. &#91;2&#93; <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05282020172154-replication-ebbinghaus.md">&#40;Click for results of that study here&#41;</a></p>
<p>The spacing effect has not been very well utilized in US-based education institutes despite its multitudinous benefits. &#91;3&#93; Cepeda et al. determined that in a memory based challenge, spaced based learning outperformed massed learning ~96&#37; of the time. &#91;4&#93; This coincides with the deficient processing view posited by Hintzman that stated how massed repetition leads to a lack of attention in later reviews. &#91;5&#93;</p>
<p>According to <em>Pyc and Rawson</em>, labored but correct recall while practicing improves memory. Spacing items of recall produce greater effort during retrieval and enables thorough conversion of the item to memory. <sup id="fnref:1">[1]</sup> &#91;6&#93; Semantic processing of information during repetitions assists in making that information more <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03172020033742-antifragility.md">anti-fragile, to borrow from Nassim Taleb,</a> during reviews. This causes performance in later memory testing to be unaffected by changes in such things like the type of font used when presented information. <sup id="fnref:2">[2]</sup> &#91;7&#93; </p>
<p>However, a confounding factor in the idea of the spacing effect is the encoding variability theory. This theory states that one&#39;s performance on a memory test is related to overlaps amongst current contextualized material both during testing and while encoding. According to this view, spaced repetition typically entails some variability in presentation contexts. Yet, this results in a positive outcome being that there are then more retrieval cues associated with that material. &#91;8&#93;</p>
<p>However, there are concerns about the spacing effect that have impeded its overall adoption into educational formats. <em>Dempster</em> made a case examining potential rationales for the lack of adoption in a review of the current state of the spacing effect &#40;though the study is old over 30 years old, it still remains that education systems do not incorporate the spacing effect&#41;. &#91;3&#93; His biggest point of concern was the lack of studies that showed effective classroom utilization of the method.</p>
<p>Despite such misgivings, it is still a phenomenon that have given rise to many benefits and potential applications for at least personal education. Principle of which is in the form of<a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05252020183020-spaced-repetition-systems.md">spaced repetition systems.</a> These systems have determined the best spacing algorithms for a learner to use the spacing effect to assist in learning diverse educational material.</p>

<h3 id="study_set-up">Study Set-up</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Due to time constraints, 10 replications per time interval was used, instead of the 12 to 45 by Ebbinghaus. This means the variance in our data is larger than in Ebbinghaus&#39; especially at the longest time intervals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Were not able to experiment at fixed times during the day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our stimulus material conformed to the phonotactics of the Dutch language</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our subject was younger than H. Ebbinghaus</p>
</li>
<li><p>We do not know exactly when he learned and relearned the lists for the longer intervals. Makes it impossible to calculate the number of interfering lists between learning and relearning. nearly certain that our schedule differed from his</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A practice phase was used to prevent general learning effects due to growing experience with the task and materials.</p>
<p>The number of correct syllables at first reproduction of a row at relearning. Did not have to be the correct location where the word was learned.</p>
<p>The main value monitored was amount of repetitions required to correctly reproduce syllables in a row sequence.</p>
<p>Learning material consisted of 70 lists. Each list consisted of 104 nonsense syllables, which in turn consisted of 8 &#39;rows&#39; of 13 syllables.</p>
<p>Lists were printed on paper in black ink with font &quot;Calibri&quot; at size 11. There were eight rows per page. Each row was arranged into a column format for ease of study. Rows not being studied were covered by sheets of paper.</p>
<p>Syllables consisted of 3 or 4 lower-case letters. Its structure was a lower-case consonant-vowel-consonant.</p>
<p>Syllables with meanings in other languages spoken by the subject, such as English and German, were not excluded.</p>
<p>These are the key points that differentiate their study from Ebbinghaus&#39;s original study. Furthermore, listed is how the study was conducted. </p>

<p>Savings is time minimized on an upcoming learning trial after having had prior exposure to that learning material. Hermann Ebbinghaus came up with this idea&#33; An example of this concept is: imagine one repeated a list 25 times to prefectly memorize the list. After a day of rest, instead of 25 repititions to relearn the list, one only needs 20. In this sense, a saving of 20&#37; took place.</p>
<p>Single-subject studies are normal in memory psychology. Especially common concerning autobiographical memory based on one&#39;s own memories &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93;. A benefit is that no intersubject variability exists. However, these studies need hundreds of trials to decrease variance based on confounding stimuli.</p>
<p>Ebbinghaus used nonsense syllables as material to learn for his experiments. He did this because he thought that legitimate material could be complicated by his pre-existing memories leading to a higher variance in his experimental data. &#91;4&#93;  Many scientists in experimental psychology now use this same approach.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that the first night&#39;s sleep post-learning has an important impact on memory that may continue to adapt several days after. A temporary increase in the forgetting curve where subjects score better than after learning in the days following sleep can be seen. However, it is not experienced if they skipped the night of sleep after learning &#91;5&#93;</p>
<p>How sleep can impact and benefit the learning of new material. The forgetting curve is not completely smooth and jumps at the 1 day retention interval. One possible explanation for this jump is based on the effects of sleep on memory. However, that explanation has not been proven for this study type.</p>
<p><strong>Implicit memory:</strong> where an individual may not be consciously aware they still possess traces of memory representations but one cannot actively recall or recognize these representations. These old traces do show savings when relearning that corresponding material. <em>RQ: This intuitively makes sense to me after much study and practice in languages and other domains. I wonder how long implicit memory lasts?</em></p>
<p><strong>Memory Chain Model:</strong> posits memory passes through several neural processes - &quot;stores&quot; - as it transitions from short-term to long-term memory. &#91;6&#93; It can be used to model the forgetting curve and &quot;savings&quot;. Store 1, the hippocampus, acts as a temporary storage which decreases exponentially in intensity. Store 2, the neocortex, is for long-term memory where it declines at a much slower rate. Store 1 gradually shifts its contents to Store 2. The decay rates in Store 1 and Store 2 are given by \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\), respectively. The initial strength of the memory traces in Store 1 are given by \(\mu_{1}\) and the rate of consolidating the contents of Store 1 to Store 2 is given by μ2. Lesioning Store 1, will produce a retrograde amnesia gradient that can be modeled by the Memory Chain Model simultaneously with the forgetting gradient of healthy controls. &#91;7&#93; The Memory Chain Model &#40;MCM&#41; equation for type of savings studied here is given by \(Q(t) = \mu_{1}e^{a_{1}t} + \frac{\mu_{1}\mu_{2}(e^{-a_{2}t} - e^{-a_{1}t})}{a_{1} -a_{2}}\)The MCM function has the same number of parameters but they are arranged differently. The proof that this equation is a mathematical formalization of the memory consolidation process can be found elsewhere. &#91;7&#93;</p>

<p>Performance is a quantifiable metric that is observed in teaching or practice.</p>
<p>Performance is not a valid metric to determine if learning is occuring.</p>
<p>Storage strength defines how interassociated a representation of memory is to relevant experiences &#40;such as knowledge or skills&#41;.</p>
<p>Learning is the idea of creating permanent changes in one&#39;s understanding or knowledge regarding a particular subject.</p>
<p>Factors that quickly improve retrieval strength are different from those that improve storage strength. If learners mistake retrieval strength as storage strength, a learner could mistakenly be led to believe that situations which improve retrieval strength could improve storage strength.</p>

<p>Difficulties which can encourage learning: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Varied learning conditions as opposed to constant and predictable ones.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interleaving instruction on separate topics together.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spacing study sessions on a given topic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using tests as study events. &#91;1&#93;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning how to learn is the ultimate survival tool. </p>
<p>Rather do not fret over inputs but rather, output. Consolidate reading material from memory. Get with others to drill one another with questions. Activites that test your ability to generate explications yields more robust learning experiences.</p>
<p>Memory does not function like a video recorder. Reviewing the same material ad nauseam is not effective for memory. Learning involves attaching novel information to what is known by oneself. </p>
<p>Generating an explanation about a topic rather than just being given a solution can be more effective than the spacing effect. This is called the generation effect.</p>
<p>Learning difficulties which are desirable trigger encoding and retrieval processes that support storage strength. If the learner is unable to successfully handle presented difficulties, they become impediments rather than helps to learning.</p>
<p>Retrieval strength explains the ease in accessing a representation of a specific memory in the brain. It is signficantly affected by factors such as cues and recency of exposure to a material related to that representation.</p>
<p>Studying the same material in two different rooms rather the same room leads to increased recall of that material. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>Interleaved practice produces higher quality prolonged retention and promotes skill transferability. In comparison to blocked practice and other sorts of mass practicing. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Blocked practice is deceptive; it is not the best form of learning though it can appear to be so. &#91;3&#93; </p>
<p>It is suggested that interleaving material forces one to differentiate between different topics. When pressured, this can heighten one&#39;s perception about differentiators. It leads to better embedding of abstractions that foster retention and transfer. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Participants in a motor skills test received 18 patterned trials via a pinball-like machine set-up. Participants were presented with randomly determined patterns &#40;interleaved&#41; or individual patterns that were practiced consecutively &#40;blocked&#41; on the machine. Blocked participants quickly improved versus interleaved participants. After a 10 day break, participants retested under blocked or interleaved conditions. Presented random conditions, the original interleaved participants performed superior to the blocked participants. Blocked participants appeared to have learned nothing. Presented blocked conditions, results were approximately the same but the minimal differences favored interleaving. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Testing is seen as a means of quantitative assessment but not for learning purposes. This is in contradiction to the fact that testing can be highly a highly beneficial tool for learning rather than a measurement of learning taking place. </p>
<p>8 and 12 year olds practiced tossing beanbags at a target on the floor while having their vision blocked at each throw. Half of each age group practiced throwing at a fixed distance target. The rest threw at targets of varying distances. After sufficient practices and a break, all children were tested under fixed target conditions for their age group. Children who practiced at variable distances performed better than fixed target participants. Introducing variation outmatched benefits of fixed distance practice. &#91;4&#93;</p>

<p>There are multiple algorithms available used for effectively implementing the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05282020163507-spacing-effect.md">spacing effect</a>. The earliest algorithm comes from the original discoverer of the spacing effect, Hermann Ebbinghaus. The algorithm <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05282020172154-replication-ebbinghaus.md">has been replicated</a> and scrutinized examined multiple times. &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93; Spaced repetition systems are based around proper implementations of such algorithms.</p>
<p>Before the advent of computers, it was very difficult to implement such a system. The best system to take advantage of this effect was the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05102020220941-leitner-system.md">Leitner System which used paper note cards</a> to assist with remembering information. However, this was still a somewhat fragile system and difficult to manage.</p>
<p>With computers, there have been several pieces of software made to automate and keep track of repetitions <em>for a learner</em>. A majority of these systems directly adapted the Leitner System from the analog to the digital world. Each software generally has proprietary algorithms that supposedly maximize the spacing effect but are directly inspired by the original work done by Ebbinghaus.</p>
<p>Whether analog or digital, key features of these systems are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Uses an algorithm implementation of the spacing effect for a user.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each piece of information is spaced automatically per a user&#39;s perceived difficulty in either remembering or processing that piece of information on a repetition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pieces of information are generally presented in a &quot;flashcard&quot; format and are stored in &quot;decks&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Hebbian Learning discusses the simultaneous activation of cells leading to increased synaptic strengthening between those cells. &#40;Also known as Associative Learning&#41;</p>
<p>Hebbian theory discusses the way neurons may associate or connect themselves together to become engrams.</p>
<p>Mirror neurons present an interesting question regarding how do people have neurons that are both affected when executing an action and listening to or witnessing someone else execute a related action.</p>
<p>Hebbian theory would predict that as individuals perform particular actions, they will see, hear, and feel themselves perform that action. Synapses connecting the neurons that respond to external stimuli and those triggering the action should be potentiated. The reason for this is that the sensory neurons will consistently overlap in time with those of the motor neurons that caused the action thus triggering activity in the re-afferent sensory neurons. &#91;1&#93; A. Lahav, E. Saltzman, and G. Schlaug, &quot;Action representation of sound: audiomotor recognition network while listening to newly acquired actions,&quot; Journal of Neuroscience, vol. 27, no. 2, pp. 308–314, 2007. &#91;2&#93; M. D. Giudice, V. Manera, and C. Keysers, &quot;Programmed to learn? The ontogeny of mirror neurons,&quot; Developmental science, vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 350–363, 2009.</p>
<p>An engram is where, in the brain, a pathway to a thought or memory is repeatedly stimulated causing strong interassociations. The brain automatically adjusts to turn on elements that are related to the thought or memory and tune out unrelated elements.</p>

<p>The consideration of only monotonic effects were accounted. Relationships between digital media use and health are generally non-monotonic. Associations often follow a J-shaped curve. The first issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. This is nicknamed the Goldilocks hypothesis which was posited by Przybylski himself. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; A. K. Przybylski and N. Weinstein, &quot;A large-scale test of the goldilocks hypothesis: quantifying the relations between digital-screen use and the mental well-being of adolescents,&quot; Psychological Science, vol. 28, no. 2, pp. 204–215, 2017.</p>
<p>The global adolescent mental health crisis started around 2012 and greatly affects girls more so than boys &#91;5&#93;. As TV is now commonplace and TV watching amongst adolescents has declined after 2012 &#91;6&#93;, TV watching does not suggest an adequate explanation for the sudden increase in mental health disorders. The second issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;5&#93; S. McManus et al., &quot;Prevalence of non-suicidal self-harm and service contact in England, 2000–14: repeated cross-sectional surveys of the general population,&quot; The lancet psychiatry, vol. 6, no. 7, pp. 573–581, 2019. &#91;6&#93; J. M. Twenge, G. N. Martin, and B. H. Spitzberg, &quot;Trends in US Adolescents’ media use, 1976–2016: The rise of digital media, the decline of TV, and the &#40;near&#41; demise of print.,&quot; Psychology of Popular Media Culture, vol. 8, no. 4, p. 329, 2019.</p>
<p>The Monitoring the Future dataset examines digital media usage via two ways. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A minimal variance scale with labels that range from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;almost every day.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>A sufficiently varied count of weekly hours spent on digital media.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, Orben and Przybylski only included low-variance items. The fourth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; J. E. Schulenberg, L. D. Johnston, P. M. O’Malley, J. G. Bachman, R. A. Miech, and M. E. Patrick, &quot;Monitoring the Future national survey results on drug use, 1975-2016: Volume II, College students and adults ages 19-55,&quot; 2017.</p>
<p>Including controls that could in fact be mediators. The fifth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. Orben and Przybylski control for factors such as negative attitudes towards school, time spent with parents, parent distress and closeness to parents, which could be caused by heavy social media use. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4.</p>
<p>Using \(r^{2}\) for effect size has multiple problems. The sixth issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski. &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; C. J. Ferguson, &quot;An effect size primer: a guide for clinicians and researchers.,&quot; 2016. &#91;2&#93; D. C. Funder and D. J. Ozer, &quot;Evaluating effect size in psychological research: Sense and nonsense,&quot; Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 156–168, 2019.</p>
<p>Heavy use of social media is regularly correlated with negative mental health outcomes of varying severity. This relationship disproportionately affects girls. Given that there is no plausible alternative explanation for this association, associations with a variety of adverse mental health conditions in girls should not be dismissed. Adverse events being rising rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide &#91;0&#93; J. M. Twenge, J. Haidt, T. E. Joiner, and W. K. Campbell, &quot;Underestimating digital media harm,&quot; Nat Hum Behav, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 346–348, Apr. 2020, doi: 10.1038/s41562-020-0839-4. &#91;1&#93; S. McManus et al., &quot;Prevalence of non-suicidal self-harm and service contact in England, 2000–14: repeated cross-sectional surveys of the general population,&quot; The lancet psychiatry, vol. 6, no. 7, pp. 573–581, &#91;1&#93; &#91;2&#93; J. M. Twenge, &quot;Why increases in adolescent depression may be linked to the technological environment,&quot; Current opinion in psychology, vol. 32, pp. 89–94, 2020.2019.</p>
<p>Effect sizes include many individual items. These are lower in internal reliability than multiple-item scales and thus produce lower effect sizes. Scales with more items count more heavily in the analysis because they have more items. &#91;1&#93; L. J. Cronbach and P. E. Meehl, &quot;Construct validity in psychological tests.,&quot; Psychological bulletin, vol. 52, no. 4, p. 281, 1955. The third issue raised by Jean Twenge against &quot;The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use&quot; by Orben and Przybylski</p>
<p>Mediators are a possible reason behind an effect. They should not be controlled. This is from an email conversation with Jean Twenge about this issue. For example, it is plausible that excessive social media use causes teens to spend less time with their parents. Thus this variable should not be a covariate, as it might partially explain why the correlation between social media use and depression occurs in the first place. </p>

<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<p>Let \(p_{1} = (x_{1}, y_{1})\), \(p_{2} = (x_{2}, y_{2})\), \(p = (x_{p}, y_{p})\) where \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) are two points of interest and \(p\) is either \(p_{1}\) or \(p_{2}\). The algorithm for determining the line that contains points \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) utilizes the Point-Slope Formula:</p>
\[
y_{2} - y_{1} = m(x_{2} - x_{1})
\]
<p>Can be rewritten such that</p>
\[
m = \frac{ y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}
\]
<p>To define the slope of the line in question. To generalize this to a generic solution, one reevaluates for the point slope formula using \(y\) and \(x\) as general terms:</p>
\[
y - y_{p} = m(x - x_{p})
\]
<p>To produce the final generic equation, reorganizing yields:</p>
\[
y(x) = \frac{x \cdot \left( y_{2} - y_{1} \right)}{x_{2} - x_{1}} - \frac{x_{p} \cdot \left( y_{2} - y_{1} \right)}{x_{2} - x_{1}} + y_{p}

<p>In this particular study, a cohort of 971 individuals were involved in smoking cessation sessions hosted at smoking cessation clinics between 1986 and 1990. The intervention developed at these sessions for a participant involved attending eight 90 minute group sessions over a period of 4 months. The biggest of the groups reached 110 attendees. 3 months after a group quit date, 39.3&#37; of cohort self-reported as non-smoking. Thereafter, 32.1&#37; and 26.0&#37; of the cohort at 6 and 12 months respectively reported non-smoking. Finally, at an 8 year check-in, 33.9&#37; of the cohort were reached. 47.7&#37; reported not currently smoking &#40;16.2 of total cohort&#41;. &#91;pg. 725&#93;</p>
<p>33.9&#37; and 66.1&#37; of the cohort were male and female respectively. Participants averaged an age of 39.9. &#91;pg. 729&#93; Interestingly, it was found that the motivation for the cohort came from oneself with 81.2&#37; saying they wanted to quit. 3.4&#37; said they were motivated by others and 14.5&#37; said they were motivated by themselves and others. &#91;pg. 730&#93; The participants who were not successful in quitting smoking for 3 months reported not being prepared to quit. &#91;pg. 737&#93; The success rates that were reported were reasonably not significantly biased to positive or negative outcomes due to a loose balance between those who started with both <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05182020005014-smoking-recovery-indicators.md">great and poor quitting conditions</a> &#40;linked to related quitting factors&#41;. &#91;pg. 732&#93; Race was not accounted for in this study.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>Each session included topics such as education about the negative consequences of smoking, how to self monitor, and strategies for modifying behavior to disassociate smoking from pleasure. &quot;Butt jars&quot; were used to create aversive sensations to smoking via association with pictures of cancerous organs. In contrast, non-smoking behavior was rewarded in the idea of a &quot;money jar&quot;. The money jar contains the money a participant would have used for smoking and is instead set aside to be used to finance enjoyable activity. &#91;pg. 728&#93;</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The part of the study program most helpful to participants was the supportive nature of the large group setting. Despite large group sizes, individuals thought they were supported very well. The support and the accepting, non-judgemental atmosphere provided in groups promoted cessation. This study illustrated that a Cognitive Behavioral grounding in smoking cessation can produce success with large group participant. &#91;pg. 738&#93;</p>

<p>Let \(v\) and \(w\) be any two vectors and let \(c\) and \(d\) represent any real numbers. Multiplying \(v\) and \(w\) by \(c\) and \(d\) respectively yields \(cv\) and \(dw\).</p>
<p>Adding \(cv\) and \(dw\) together is the idea of a linear combination.</p>
\[
cv + dw = c\begin{bmatrix} v_{1}\\ v_{2} \end{bmatrix} + d\begin{bmatrix} w_{1}\\ w_{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} cv_{1} + dw_{1}\\ cv_{2} + dw_{2} \end{bmatrix}

<p>There exist two definitions for vectors:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A vector is a column of a matrix.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A vector is that which has the algebra of a vector space.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be summarized by saying: not all vectors which have the algebra of a vector space are columns of matrices.</p>

<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>The Leitner system uses flashcards to implement a spaced repetition learning system. It was created by German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s.</p>
<p><img src="1589148887796.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Successfully recalled cards are moved to the next group. Unsuccessfully recalled cards go back to the first box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the Leitner system, learners create flashcards with discrete facts on them. These cards are grouped based on how well a learner knows the information on the card. They are arranged via the following method:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a card is successfully recalled, the card is put into the next group.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a card is not successfully recalled it is sent to the first group.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cards are kept in a box and are partitioned by spacings in the box. The size of each participation determined when cards were to be reviewed. For Leitner&#39;s implementation, this consisted of 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14cm partition sizes. Reviews only took place when a partition is filled to proper sizing.</p>
<p>In Leitner&#39;s original method, published in his book So lernt man Lerne &#40;How to learn to learn&#41;, the schedule of repetition was governed by the size of the partitions in the learning box.</p>

<p>Incremental reading follows the general format. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Identify written pieces of interest.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prioritize the pieces according to personal urgency.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allocate a comfortable reading time duration per piece with a timed, short break in-between. <sup id="fnref:1">[1]</sup></p>
</li>
<li><p>While reading each piece, annotate material that is of interest or difficult to process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transfer annotations from each piece to an index card representation &#40;actual or digital&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pause reading and review collected annotations using a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05252020183020-spaced-repetition-systems.md">spaced repetition system</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once annotations have been thoroughly revised and reviewed, repeat from step 2 until finished with pieces over the next several days.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Incremental reading helps with improving focus and promotes learning while moving uniformly to finish reading. <sup id="fnref:2">[2]</sup> &#91;2&#93;, &#91;3&#93; Ingesting raw annotations into a spaced repetition system enables one to process them without being overwhelmed. On each repetition of a particular annotation, rewriting or modifying that information is crucial in cementing understanding. <sup id="fnref:3">[3]</sup> After finishing revisions and reviews, this process is repeated until done with reading the pieces.</p>

<p><sup id="fnref:2">[2]</sup> It is suggested that interleaving material forces one to differentiate between different topics.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As early as in the 1950s to 1960s, Luhmann simulated a modern computer-based database system &#91;...&#93;.&quot; &#40;pg. 59&#41;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually think that the Zettelkasten method by Luhmann is distinctly different from a computer database. The reason being, is that this is far more overlapping and far reaching than a discrete system like a simple computer database. One could argue that relations could be made analogous to relational databases but here, the relations are far more abstract than they are in the traditional relational database. If anything, Luhmann&#39;s Zettelkasten is more similar to a graph-type system - such as a knowledge graph - than a database </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Luhmann&#39;s card index allows the production of new and often unexpected knowledge by relating concepts and thoughts that do not have much in common at first sight &#91;...&#93; &#91;I&#93;t makes &#91;...&#93; serendipity possible in a systemically and theoretically informed way.&quot; &#40;pg. 54&#41;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The power of the Zettelkasten comes from these accidental connections. Very similar to how one may spread out pieces of paper on a table and make a new connection, so does this method simulate it in very much the same way.</p>
<p>Luhmann employed ambiguity and indecisiveness into the development of the Zettelkasten approach whenever he added a new piece of information to the Zettelkasten. Rather than assigning the piece of information to one discrete category, he enabled that piece of info to naturally attach itself to other pieces of information as <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020022908-education-spectrum.md">knowledge falls across a spectrum.</a> &#40;pg. 56&#41;</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> April 28 2020</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Working thought on how a person&#39;s environment can function as an extension of one&#39;s mental processes. Could possibly lead to decrease in cognitive loading.</p>

<p>I have often heard it said that a room or home reflects a person&#39;s state of mind. Ideally, a well-organized mind should map to a nicely ordered room and the logical contrapositive of that statement follows suit. However, what is not immediately understood is the notion of a room or house being an extension of that person&#39;s mental processes.</p>
<p>For example, a smoker who is attempting to quit smoking often is taught many different sorts of ways to handle cessation. Two such ideas are the notions of a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05172020232612-smoking-cessation.md">&quot;butt jar&quot; and a &quot;savings jar&quot;.</a> These are two actual jars that quitters set-up in their home to reinforce the idea of quitting. The &quot;butt jar&quot; contains the butts of cigarettes one smokes with graphic imagery of cancerous organs to associate adverse events with smoking more clearly. The other &quot;savings jar&quot; is a reward system where quitters put the money they would have spent on smoking into the jar. They then can use this money for whatever pleasurable or fun activity they please.</p>
<p>Here, the jars work as a physical extension of the mind. Furthermore, I once had a professor named Debra Dudick at Corning Community College. Her desk was an absolute mess covered with stacks of papers and books everywhere. A little nook in the corner of her desk was carved out for her computer. Yet, she knew where every single file, book, or reference that she needed was despite the mess. And as the chair of the Engineering Department, she needed speed in her work.</p>
<p>Somehow, her mind made disparate associations across her desk that actually helped her find what she was looking for. One could reason that due to the extra labor it took to sift through materials, her mind automatically made connections between object and place to facilitate easier finding. This is in opposition to the idea of having everything clean. Instead, the desk became an external mapping of her mind that was only activated when needed.</p>
<p>The question remains if this is a viable means to extending human thought and to decrease cognitive load. The human mind is not neatly organized, rather, much like an unkempt desk, its connections are far and wide across the brain. So why do we attempt to force our environment in this way?</p>

<h3 id="psalm_5_scripture">Psalm 5 Scripture</h3>
<pre><code class="language-julia">Listen to my words, Lord, 
consider my lament. 
Hear my cry for help,
my King and my God,
for to you I pray.In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice;
in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.&#91;...&#93;But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
    let them ever sing for joy.
Spread your protection over them,
    that those who love your name may rejoice in you.Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous;
you surround them with your favor as with a shield.                                        - Psalms 5:1-3, 11-12</code></pre>
<h3 id="exegesis">Exegesis</h3>
<p>One of the key things to note about this passage is when the Psalmist chooses to lay his requests before God – the morning. If you wake up and the very first thing you do is cry and lament before God, then this illustrates a point of extreme stress. The object of stress in this Psalm is enough to haunt the writer&#39;s every waking moment. It causes enough concern for the Psalmist to wait on God to answer the writer.</p>
<p>Yet, what may or may not be implied from this is that the Psalmist still chooses rest and/or sleep. In verses 11 - 12, the Psalmist knows that God protects and blesses those who love Him and he chooses to have faith and trust in that knowledge to rest and rejoice. </p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> April 25 2020</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> An overview on how to use and implement a median filter</p>

<p>It is a non-linear digital filtering technique, used to remove noise from an image or signal. The main idea of the median filter is to run through the signal value by value, replacing each value with the median of neighboring values. The pattern of neighbors is called the &quot;window&quot;, which slides, entry by entry, over the entire signal.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<p>An explanation of implementing the algorithm is given in example form:</p>
<p>Given the original signal, \(x = (2, 3, 80, 6)\), a 1D Median Filter is applied as follows:</p>
\[
y1 = med(2, 3, 80) = 3
\]
\[
y2 = med(3, 80, 6) = med(3, 6, 80) = 6
\]
\[
y3 = med(80, 6, 2) = med(2, 6, 80) = 6
\]
\[
y4 = med(6, 2, 3) = med(2, 3, 6) = 3
\]
<p>Which yields the final filtered signal, \(y = (3, 6, 6, 3)\).</p>
<h4 id="additional_consideration">Additional Consideration</h4>
<p>In the example implementation, there is no value preceding the first value, thus the window &quot;wraps&quot; around the original to fulfill its window size.</p>
<p>There are other ways to handle filling the window other than wrapping such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoiding selecting values directly located at either boundary of the signal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use other values from within the signal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shrink the window near the edges of the signal so that the window is always full.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, it is very good for salt-and-pepper noise/impulse noise &#40;e.g. noise that is caused by sharp and sudden disturbances in the image signal&#41;</p>

<p>Defined as the use of multiple technologies or location systems simultaneously to form hierarchical and overlapping levels of sensing, sensor fusion can provide aggregate properties unavailable when using location systems individually</p>
<p>This definition of data fusion comes from <em>Hightower &amp; Borriello</em> &#91;1&#93; and I think it provides a very good explanation of what data fusion actually is. I decided to generalize it as their definition only concerns with location systems – here is my paraphrase:</p>
<p>When one utilizes differing technologies to form tiers of improving sensor accuracy; this methodology can compensate for the loss or absence of signal from other sensors by providing multiple overlaps for the same defining properties of a system.</p>

<p>I read a Q&amp;A article on Barbara Liskov &#91;1&#93; and the author made a very interesting comparison between Liskov&#39;s work of designing paradigms for creating well structured and crafted code with that of a Poet or Novelist. I have heard of comparisons like this before but I was quite intrigued by the latter – a programmer being compared to a writer. What piqued my interest the most about the article was the following statement,</p>
<p>&quot;As a computer scientist thinking about code, Liskov had no physical objects to work with. Like a novelist or a poet, <em>she was staring at a blank page</em>.&quot; &#40;emphasis added&#41;</p>
<p>The end of that statement, &quot;<em>blank page</em>&quot;, reminded me of the book <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em> &#91;2&#93; and my note on the book where Ahrens essentially believes that starting with a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03292020180520-smart-notes.md">blank page is the wrong idea in writing</a>. I wonder if the same could be true about programming. In effect, does a global approach to building software make more sense than to artificially package each and every piece of software separately? Could an approach like the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020031549-zettelkasten.md">Zettelkasten method</a> where, according to its <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020031618-zettelkasten-principles.md">principles</a>, each thought is kept to itself and then linked to different associated pieces of knowledge, map to software development?</p>
<p>Upon reflection upon this note some time later, I think I was thinking about the concept of composition and composition of software&#33;</p>

<p>The term <em>EDA</em> is often used synonymously in academic literature to refer to its usage as a non-invasive biomarker to investigate physiological arousal. EDA is generally recorded using two small electrodes and are usually &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93; can be placed on the:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fingers</p>
</li>
<li><p>Palms</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These electrodes complete a circuit across the skin – the skin acts as a variable resistor – and then <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03242020003215-eda-explained.md">measure changes in skin conductance</a> &#40;see note for more information on what variables EDA monitors&#41;.

<p>Skin conductance response &#40;SCR&#41; are the fast portions found in the decomposition of the EDA signal. They are then superimposed onto the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04092020161622-skin-conductance.md">Skin Conductance Level</a> &#40;click link to see what the SCL is&#41;.</p>
<p>Conventionally &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93;, SCR is classified via the following criterion:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An increase in EDA of at least \(0.05\mu S\) over a period of \(1 - 3\) seconds</p>
</li>
<li><p>Immediately after this increase, there should be seen a gradual decrease in EDA over \(3 - 15\) seconds to what value &#40;or <em>level</em>&#41; was recorded before the SCR event</p>
</li>

<h3 id="rule-based_algorithm">Rule-based Algorithm</h3>
<p>The authors also decided to create a very simple rule-based algorithm in an effort to make results easily reproducible and understandable to researchers of differing backgrounds. This algorithm for assessing data quality was as is follows:</p>
<table><tr><th align="center">Number</th><th align="center">Rule</th><th align="center">Rationale</th></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">EDA is not within the range of \(0.05 - 60 \mu S\)</td><td align="center">Prevent &quot;floor&quot; and &quot;ceiling&quot; artifacts</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">EDA fluctuates too fast \((+/- 10 \frac{\mu S}{second})\)</td><td align="center">To prevent &quot;jump&quot; artifacts</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">Temperature not within 30-40 \(C\)</td><td align="center">Preserve best accuracy of data</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">EDA data within \(5\) sec of invalid sections</td><td align="center">Invalid sections based on rules \(1-3\)</td></tr></table>
<p>If the data did not adhere to these rules, it was classified as artifact. </p>
<h4 id="notes_on_algorithm_rules">Notes on Algorithm Rules</h4>
<p><em>1. In Rule 1, 60 was chosen as an upper limit specifically because that was the upper limit of the Q Sensor.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Rule 2&#39;s rationale came from &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93;</em></p>
<p><em>3. For Rule 3, their data recorded temperatures of 32 - 36 \(C\) consistently for individuals</em></p>

<p>I am not in full agreement that learning material should normally be presented in a linear fashion as the brain itself is not ordered generally in a linear fashion but rather a global and far-reaching format. My question is global learning a more effective presentation of knowledge type than linear learning? This thought was inspired by <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em> &#91;1&#93; </p>
<p>This idea is also linked to the idea of <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03092020022908-education-spectrum.md">Education as a Spectrum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Takeaways from the book How to Take Smart Notes</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##bibliography #knowledge #notetaking #zettelkasten #mentalmodels #writing #blog #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>S. Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers.</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Quotes from the Book:</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>This was overall a book on knowledge management – in particular, how to take, digest, and use the notes we make while reading material, listening to lectures, or absorb knowledge in general. Sonke Ahrens, the author of the book, also gave a rather in-depth overview of the Zettelkasten method created by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. I found the book useful in giving legitimately very good advice on note-taking, great anecdotes to illustrate his point, and also assistance on using the Zettelkasten method. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Ahrens made an interesting point saying that if you are approaching writing where you start with just a blank page, you are missing the point. When you approach a blank page, it <em>ought</em> not feel blank but rather the place to put your notes and ideas together that you have been collecting about a particular topic. Ahrens believes that fundamental teachings about how to write long-form papers are wrong in that they do not start with the most crucial aspect of the writing process – free form thought. And free form thought, when investigating a topic, is best captured using a global sort of note taking method like the Zettelkasten.</p>
<h3 id="quotes_from_the_book">Quotes from the Book:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-julia">&quot;Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note&quot; &#91;pg 8&#93;&quot;We only write if it helps us with our own thinking.&quot; &#91;pg 101&#93;</code></pre>
<p>These two quotes get at the idea that when we write and create notes, we are not only creating notes but also playing with ideas and digesting them into our minds.</p>

<p>Mental models are provide you with patterns of thinking. To paraphrase the author, Sonke Ahrens, in his book, <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em>, well-crafted structures &#40;in our case mental models&#41; are things you can trust as it works in the background to manage everything that prevents you from getting to what is of most importance &#91;1&#93;</p>

<p>The exponential smoothing algorithm is a recursive algorithm and is one of the more simple smoothing methods commonly used to remove small noise and motion artifacts from a discrete time series signal. However, it can be considered a &quot;manual&quot; algorithm due to having to manually determine a smoothing factor for it to work properly.</p>
<p>Per conversation with Post-Doc Researcher, Fredrik Bagge Carlson, another definition for the smoothing factor is the &quot;forgetting factor&quot;. A bigger value for the forgetting factor results in forgetting the memory built into the algorithm faster and focusing more on recent inputs.</p>
<p>Also, this method is classified as a moving average filter&#33;</p>
<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
<p>The algorithm is very simple in which it is described as:</p>
\[
s_1 = x_1
\]
\[
s_t = ax_t + (1 - \alpha)s_{t - 1} \space | \space t > 0
\]
<p>The variables are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
\[
    \{x_t\}
    \]
<p>  * The raw signal sequence</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
\[
    \{s_t\}
    \]
<p>  * The smoothed output signal sequence</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
\[
    t
    \]
<p>  * Time &#40;where &#36;t &gt; 0&#36;&#41;</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
\[
    \alpha
    \]
<p>  * Smoothing factor &#40;must be chosen such that &#36;0 &lt; \alpha &lt;1&#36;&#41;</p>
<p>The weighted average in this case works when you take a portion of the current value x&#40;t&#41; from the original signal and a portion of the s&#40;t -1&#41; is summed together after being scaled by the forgetting factor. &#91;Explanation thanks to Fredrik Bagge Carlson&#93;</p>
<h4 id="additional_considerations">Additional Considerations</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Each term in the sequence, \(\{s_t\}\), is counted as the weighted average of the current data point from the sequence \(\{x_t\}\) and the prior smoothed statistic, \(s_t\).</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no clear method for choosing the value of the smoothing factor</p>
<ul>
<li>&#36;0 &lt;&lt;\alpha &lt; 1&#36;
<p>yields a smaller smoothing effect and &quot;value&quot; updating values more highly</p>
</li>
<li>&#36;0 &lt; \alpha &lt;&lt; 1&#36;
<p>yields a greater smoothing effect but does not respond greatly to recent updates</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>EDA artifacts can come from the electrodes used to collect EDA data &#91;1&#93;–&#91;3&#93;; examples being:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inconsistent pressure of the electrode to the skin</p>
</li>
<li><p>Physical activity &#40;such as pressure or movement&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Arbitrary changes made to securing the device</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contextual/ambient factors &#40;such as humidity, temperature, etc. Anything that can cause excessive EDA signals beyond a device&#39;s detection abilities&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overloading a device that records EDA signals is a special kind of artifact called &quot;bridging&quot; or &quot;saturation&quot;. &#91;4&#93;</p>

<p>They had a small cohort of nine individuals working at a call center using skin conductance sensors to measure EDA. They used exponential smoothing and chose a smoothing factor, \(\alpha\), of \(0.8\) – it was unclear why this was chosen. They also elected to normalize the skin conductance signals on each individual between \(0\) and \(1\) to reduce variability between the cohort members. </p>

<p>Electrodermal activity &#40;EDA&#41; broadly refers to any electrical activity across the dermis of the skin &#40;the dermis being the outermost layer of the skin&#41;. Whenever the body experiences stress – this could be in the form of an ambient temperature change, physical activity, etc. – the sympathetic nervous system &#40;SNS&#41; increases sudomotor innervation, which leads to increases in EDA and sweating. The SNS is directly influenced by parts of the brain responsible for emotional response – the hypothalamus and limbic system. Because of this codependency, EDA is commonly used to study stress and other affective behavior &#40;mood, disorders, etc.&#41;.</p>
<p>EDA has been used to study the following sort of conditions:</p>
<ul>

<p>The use cases of EDA is further explored by <em>Boucsein et. al.</em> in their book, <em>Electrodermal Activity</em>. &#91;11&#93;</p>
<p>Furthermore, EDA is a generalization of the overall signal – in reality, this signal is often decomposed into <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04092020162632-skin-response.md">Skin Conductance Response &#40;SCR&#41;</a> and <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/04092020161622-skin-conductance.md">Skin Conductance Level &#40;SCL&#41;</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Thoughts on why I think JITRs are inferior to causal models.</p>

<p>I think Remembrance and Just In-Time Information Retrieval Agents &#40;nicknamed JITRs&#41; &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93; partially – maybe by about 75&#37; – miss the point of truly aiding the human mind. On the surface, these tools come close to mimicking the chain of sub-thoughts and actions associated with a thought. A chain of thought being described in the following example: </p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">Thought: I wonder if I need my umbrella for today?
Goal: Find out if I need my umbrella for the day.Sub-Thought 1: I wonder what the weather is like for today?
Sub-Thought 2: I wonder what the probability of rain is for today?
Sub-Thought 3: I wonder where I should find this information?Action 1: Person searches for weather forecast on internet.
Action 2: Person finds local weather forecast.
Action 3: Person identifies chance of rain.Information Retrieved: There is a 75&#37; chance of rain today.Conclusion: I need my umbrella</code></pre>
<p>However, JITRs best option is to guess at what the eventual end goal of a chain of thought is but it has to forego guessing the sub-thoughts leading to the desired conclusion. I think that is why JITRs have found use, but I think it is the wrong problem to address. </p>
<p>In practice it is a very different approach, but I think to use causal modeling similar to what Judea Pearl posits is the better approach &#91;3&#93;, &#91;4&#93;.</p>
<p>Topically a JITR could watch you begin searching for allergies on a computer. Immediately, it delivers you results on common allergies. This could be useful but still is not the <em>most</em> useful as it is just guessing based on the search and some of the context of your search query. In actuality, you were trying to find information about the pollen level of your area for the day and if you should take your allergy medication prophylactically.</p>
<p>Instead, a causal agent might function similarly at first but instead of giving you a list of allergies, gives you more concise information. The causal agent infers, based on some history it has of you, you are worried if you should take your allergy medication that day. Instead, the agent just gives you information on pollen levels throughout the week based on local weather reports.</p>
<p>Though one can argue that there is guessing at place in either situation I think the latter proves far more effective than the former approach.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In the monthly plan, one should use this as a big picture preview of the upcoming month and each day you should only have one item about the biggest event for that day. Keep it short and concise&#33;&#33;&#33;</p>
<h3 id="monthly_breakdown">Monthly Breakdown</h3>
<p>Each day is logged here; furthermore, the following can be recorded:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Goals for the month</p>
</li>
<li><p>Major upcoming tasks for the month</p>
</li>
<li><p>Habits &#40;good to break it down as a daily chart of sorts&#41;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Choose what works for you and continue with it; with the major upcoming tasks, I would suggest putting that in your monthly log.</p>
<h3 id="templates">Templates:</h3>
<h4 id="habit_tracker">Habit Tracker</h4>
<p>Here is an example of a habit tracker that could be included in the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03192020035337-bullet-journal-weekly.md">weekly plan for each week</a>:</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>GTD consists of utilizing lists to break down information as it enters your brain. Here are the main lists used:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Intake</strong> - this is raw information that may come in from your colleagues, class, or situation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Projects</strong> - this contains what projects you have going on</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Next Actions</strong> - tasks that require immediate or imminent volition go here</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Waiting For</strong> - tasks that you delegate or are waiting on others to accomplish</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Future List</strong> - tasks or ideas that may be a stretch at the current moment but worth revisiting</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="implementation_flow_chart">Implementation Flow Chart</h3>
<p>It can be somewhat confusing to parse the intake; this flow diagram shows and easy to use method of how to break down information:</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you want the daily entry to: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Be concise and minimal</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contain your tasks for the day</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contain your agenda for the day</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You could Split each entry in half with daily agenda on top and tasks on the bottom</p>
<h3 id="keys">Keys</h3>
<p>A general rule of thumb is to keep symbology as simple as possibly in bullet journal. Therefore, here are the biggest and most important symbols in bullet journaling&#33;</p>
<h3 id="task_symbols">Task Symbols</h3>
<p>Here are some common symbols one can use for task management and daily review:</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li><p>I am a task&#33; </p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li><p>I am a subtask&#33;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>? - I am a migrated task - I was either moved to a later day ? - I am a task in progress ? - I am a completed task&#33;</p>

<h1>Weekly Planning in a Bullet Journal</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> March 19 2020</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> How to create a weekly plan when using a bullet journal.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> ##zettel #bulletjournal #productivity #weekly #gtd #archive</p>
<h1>Bibliography</h1>
<p>Not Available</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li><ol><li>Layout</li><li>Preview</li><li>Review</li></ol></li><li>How To Cite</li><li>References</li><li>Discussion: </li></ol></div>
<p>The weekly plan is very similar to the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03192020013347-bullet-journal-month.md">monthly plan</a> but is on a much smaller scale. If anything, it is much more similar to a weekly planner with an added twist of being an exercise in reflection and journaling. The weekly plan comprises of two main parts being:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Preview - where you plan for the week ahead</p>
</li>
<li><p>Review - where you reflect on the previous week</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<p>Generally, it is very brief and contains the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Major to-do&#39;s of the week</p>
</li>
<li><p>Major events of the week marked on corresponding day</p>
</li>
<li><p>Review of the previous week in a short form journal</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, one could also include something like a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03192020013347-bullet-journal-month.md">habit tracking system</a> for each week as well.</p>
<h3 id="preview">Preview</h3>
<p>Here is encompassed the first two points being:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Major to-do&#39;s of the week</p>
</li>
<li><p>Major events of the week marked on corresponding day</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where you schedule each day of the week based on your schedule. One can use the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03192020050207-gtd-implementation.md">&quot;Next Actions&quot; and &quot;Waiting For&quot;</a> list from the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03192020045854-get-things-done.md">GTD framework</a> to plan out your to-do&#39;s in a much more structured and useful way.</p>
<h3 id="review">Review</h3>
<p>Here is where the last point of the layout comes in - a reflection in the form of a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03192020035441-bullet-journal-daily.md##Short-Form-Journaling-Symbols">short form journal</a>. This is meant to be a brief professional reflection on the week and to reflect on the:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wins for the week</p>
</li>
<li><p>What could have been better</p>
</li>
<li><p>How you are going to improve next week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Each week, you should hold a 30 minute-ish weekly review to guarantee each project on the <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03192020050207-gtd-implementation.md">project list</a> has at least one upcoming next action for the week. </p>
<p>Utilize a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03192020050346-trigger-list.md">trigger list</a> to help make sure you did not miss anything. The trigger list should be custom to whatever it is that you are working on or are responsible for.</p>

<p>Nassim Taleb coined the word &quot;antifragile&quot; to describe systems or objects that, rather than not adapting to an environment, adapts and improves over time as a function of perturbation found in a variable environment. </p>
<p>Antifragile systems or objects gain from disorder and thrives on volatility and variability within reason for that given system.</p>
<h3 id="examples_from_talebs_model">Examples from Taleb&#39;s Model</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>An antifragile system is not like a coffee mug - a coffee mug does not get stronger the more you use it but rather is at risk the more you use it. As a result, a coffee mug is <strong>fragile</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A cannonball however is not antifragile. You can shoot it out of a cannon, drop it, carry it, etc. Within reason, it is not going to change or adapt to the situation - it is <strong>robust</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person however is <strong>antifragile</strong>. Before a person can lift a bale of hay, they must first carry the lamb to pasture. Meaning, a person can adapt and change themselves to fit to the situation at hand - though, not immediately. They can make these changes proactively or anticipate needs for a given situation and adapt accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="what_is_sars-cov-2">What is SARS-CoV-2?</h3>
<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/03102020054429-coronavirus-definition">betacoronavirus</a>, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.</p>
<p>Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. &#91;1&#93;</p>
<p>Currently, the World Health Organization has not classified this situation as a pandemic though this stance is highly contentious. &#91;2&#93;</p>
<p>UPDATE &#40;MARCH 11th&#41;:_ As of now, this situation is now classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization. &#91;3&#93;</p>
<p>Here is an image showing its transmission across the world:</p>
<p><img src="https://jacobzelko.com/03102020050115-covid19-jhu-arcgis.jpg" alt="arcgis-sars" /></p>
<h4 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h4>
<p>The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure &#40;this is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses &#91;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus&#93;&#41; &#91;4&#93;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cough</p>

<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus &#40;named SARS-CoV-2&#41;.</p>

<p>Several estimates have suggested that the risk of dying, for those infected with covid-19 and showing its flu-like symptoms, is around 1 or 2 percent. Elderly adults have a considerably higher risk of both becoming infected and dying, as do people with compromised immune systems. The estimates might change as new data arrive, but the range of 1 to 2 percent for fatalities among the symptomatic seems to be the consensus for now. The overall fatality rate for people infected with covid-19 will be lower &quot;possibly much lower&quot; when we know how many people are infected but asymptomatic.</p>

<p>The Waveform Database &#40;WFDB&#41; Library is a record management system to handle already existing databases - it itself is not a database but a collection of tools to handle databases that follow the WFDB format. &#91;1&#93; Furthermore, WFDB can be used for viewing, analyzing, and creating recordings of physiological signals &#91;2&#93;.</p>

<p>The way that the WFDB record format works is that it utilizes &#91;pg 1, @moodyWFDBProgrammerGuide2019&#93;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Header Files</strong> to specify the characteristics of a signal &#40;sampling frequency, etc.&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Annotation Files</strong> to record annotations corresponding to a signal &#40;generally kept in time with the rest of the signal&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example_application_-_ecg_data">Example Application - ECG Data</h3>
<p>For example, when working with ECG data, the format utilizes the header and annotation files as follows &#91;pg 2 - 3, @moodyWFDBProgrammerGuide2019&#93;:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Header Files</strong> - could contain information about lead count, calibration format, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Annotation Files</strong> - could contain other information such as beat positions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="miscellaneous_notes">Miscellaneous Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>WFDB is considered a standard data format within the research world, and has found application in industry as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The WFDB format is generally used for ECG records - however, it can extend to other data formats.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A possible alternative to the WFDB record format is the European Data Format&#43; &#40;EDF&#43;&#41; &#91;see @garciamartinezLoadingPlottingFiltering2017 for more information&#93;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>My best friend Wesley Samples believes that education – and for that matter, knowledge – falls more along a spectrum than in discrete categories &#40;such as Mathematics and Biology&#41;. One can look at biology and find the idea of the golden ratio repeated across nature &#91;1&#93;, &#91;2&#93;; example being the <em>Aeonium Tabuliforme</em>:</p>
<p><img src="https://jacobzelko.com/03102020015817-aeonium-tabuliforme.jpg" alt="saucer plant" /></p>
<p>There is the idea of the creature being a biological entity motivating questions such as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why does the Nautilus have a shell like this?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What function does it serve?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kuhnian_reasoning_on_non-linearity_of_education">Kuhnian Reasoning on Non-Linearity of Education</h3>
<p>Beyond Kuhn&#39;s general <a href="https://jacobzelko.com/05152022174848-structure-revolutions.md">musing in the _Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a>, his thought can also be linked to the notion that science and education is not linear.</p>
