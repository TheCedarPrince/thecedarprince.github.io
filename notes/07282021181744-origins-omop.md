The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) was created in 2009 to reach consensus on data types, study designs, and privacy concerns while sharing data.

The ground truth for OMOP investigations were positive and negative tests regarding drugs. Examples of positive controls were:

```
- Events on drug label warnings/precautions
- If it was a causative agenda
```

Examples of negative controls were:

```
- Events not listed on drug labels
- No powered studies with evidence of potential positive association
```
