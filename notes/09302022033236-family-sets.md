### Reading Motivation

I am having trouble reading some set theoretic notation. Hoping by gaining better familiarity with family of sets, I can understand notation better. 

### Family of Sets

In brief, a family of sets could be the following:

**Definition 1:** A family of sets, $F$, could be a set of subsets over a set $X$. An example of this would be the following scenario:

Let $X = {1, 2, 3, 4}$

$$
F = \{\{\emptyset\}, \{1, 2 \},\{3, 4\}\}
$$

$$
F
$$

is non-exhaustive as there could be more subsets derived from $X$.

**Definition 2:** A family of sets, $F$, could be a set of sets where each set is independent from the others. An example of this would be the following scenario:

Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $B = \{4, 5, 6\}$, and $C = \{2, 4, 6\}$

$$
F = \{A, B, C\} = \{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{4, 5, 6\}, \{2, 4, 6\}\}
$$
