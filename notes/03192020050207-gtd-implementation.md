### Implementation

GTD consists of utilizing lists to break down information as it enters your brain. Here are the main lists used:

1. **The Intake** - this is raw information that may come in from your colleagues, class, or situation.
2. **Projects** - this contains what projects you have going on
3. **Next Actions** - tasks that require immediate or imminent volition go here
4. **Waiting For** - tasks that you delegate or are waiting on others to accomplish
5. **Future List** - tasks or ideas that may be a stretch at the current moment but worth revisiting

It can be somewhat confusing to parse the intake; this flow diagram shows and easy to use method of how to break down information:
