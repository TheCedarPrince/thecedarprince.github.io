### Motivation

I wanted to know what the most common requirements are for study packages in a network study context. This is a small overview of known requirements broken down by community.

### Requirements by Community

#### OHDSI

Network studies conducted within the context of OHDSI are premised that all data assets across all participating sites adhere to the OMOP Common Data Model. Furthermore, all said data assets need to have mappings or relationships made utilizing the OMOP standardized vocabularies. This vocabulary subsumes standard concepts across a variety of different vocabularies to enable consistency in investigations across partner sites.

It is additionally suggested that all participating sites record information about the ETL processed used to map any data asset into the OMOP Common Data Model to ensure clear understanding of how data sources are used. In practice, I personally do not see this discussion happening very often sadly. It is definitely a point of concern to make this a more regular part of networked studies. [1]
