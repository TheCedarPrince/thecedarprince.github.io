**Hypothesis:** COVID-19 case rates, case fatality, and mortality rates will be elevated for IDD persons abiding in residential group homes.

### Methods

They assume the majority of cases reported in this study are likely for symptomatic individuals.

Residential group home data are from New York Disability Advocates. Homes typically have 7 residents, but range from between 4 and 14 residents. All residents are age 18 and over. NYDA data includes: number of residents, COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, and COVID-19 deaths.

Residential group homes are required to complete a COVID-19 screen and temperature check at least once per day in homes that have not had a prior confirmed case. For a prior confirmed case, screening and checks once per shift. [1]

IDD individuals experience health disparities and high prevalence of comorbidities. [2] Many of which areassociated with more severe COVID19 outcomes. [3], [4] There is a paucity of IDD health research. [5], [6] Furthermore, the CDC only issued COVID-19 guidance relevant to this population in late May. *RQ: That's absurd how long it took the CDC to issue guidelines about this population. I wonder if WHO has issued any guidelines related to individuals with IDD?*

There may be increased risk from COVID-19 for individuals living in congregate care settings due to difficulty in maintaining physical distancing. [7]–[9] It is estimated that 13% of IDD adults reside in congregate care settings, [10] with shared use of essential living spaces, closeproximity to others, high levels of personal care assistancefrom staff, and multiple shift staffing patterns. [11]  *RQ: It seems like the authors are insinuating that individauls with IDD are at increased risk for COVID19 due to group care facilities.  Not so much biologic dysfunction. However, I think they say later there is biologic concern.*
