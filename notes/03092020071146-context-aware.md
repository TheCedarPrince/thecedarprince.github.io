**Context-aware applications** are technologies that leverage data collected from real-time environments and contexts and act upon this information to create timely actions. This idea was coined by [1] in his paper [The Aware Home: A Living Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing Research](/03092020035135-kidd-aware-home)

Here is the original quote from @kiddAwareHomeLiving1999:

> *However, progress in the sensing technologies needs to be matched by progress in supporting the rapid development of applications that use sensed information. These applications are what [are] called **context-aware applications**.*
