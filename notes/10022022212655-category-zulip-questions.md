### Outline Motivation

This outline is a tracker for all the questions I have posed to the wonderful [Category Theory Zulip Community](/https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#). Sometimes these questions and their responses are quite useful so I make sure to record them all here for posterity!

### Questions

  * [Clarifying Understanding of Coproducts](//10022022212655-category-zulip-questions.md) - A line of questioning to ensure I understand what coproducts and disjoint unions are
