### General Workflow When Working with `renv`

1. Call `renv::init()` to initialize a new project-local environment with a private R library,
2. Work in the project as normal, installing and removing new R packages as they are needed in the project,
3. Call `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of the project library to the lockfile (called `renv.lock`),
4. Continue working on your project, installing and updating R packages as needed.
5. Call `renv::snapshot()` again to save the state of your project library if your attempts to update R packages were successful, or call `renv::restore()` to revert to the previous state as encoded in the lockfile if your attempts to update packages introduced some new problems.
