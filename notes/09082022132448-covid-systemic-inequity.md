### Reading Motivation

I examined this paper to learn more about vulnerabilities posed to minority and vulnerable populations. I focused less on pandemic-related risks and more on examples of problems posed to minority populations.

### Vulnerable Population Examples

Intersectional vulnerable populations (e.g. those living with disability, poverty conditions, or racial minority, etc.) face even more perils to their already vulnerable state.

  * African Americans have the highest mortality from colorectal cancer. (3, 4)

```
- Diagnosed at younger ages 
- Intersectionally, African Americans who are poor, uninsured, and/or geographically isolated are less likely to get screening tests 
	- Less likely to receive treatment for advanced disease
```

  * Hispanics or Latinos are disproportionately affected by SDOH factors. (5)

```
- Have highest incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
```

  * Native American reservations lack low number of ICU hospital beds. (8)

```
- Indian Health Services only had limited ability to help COVID-19 patients.
```

  * Minorities are over-represented as and in: (9)

```
- Essential workers 
- Poor and overcrowded housing
- Could be impossible to adhere to COVID-19 safety policies
```
