### Recommendations

  * Using standards made with stakeholders significantly increased use of the All Payer Claims Database
  * Promote ability to analyze big claims data at population level.

> IDEA: This really seems like we could off load a lot of processing to other tools.


No need to reinvent the wheel when I think we have a lot of the tools here like in OHDSI.

  * Actively review data quality impacts.

> QUESTION: I wonder what they mean by data quality metrics?


  * Develop and adhere to a regular data update schedule
  * Consider using the Common Data Layout
  * Know about ERISA limitations on private self-insured employer plans
  * Get federal matching funds to support operation.
  * Know what All-Payers Claim Database data can do well and what it cannot.
