### Motivation

Intersectionality and intersectionality theory is a really cool emerging area of research within health research. Wanted to create this note to summarize intersectionality ideas.

### Workable Definitions of Intersectionality

  * **Intersectionality** - more describes an approach to disentangle and understand the overlapping systems of oppression that contribute to inequality (Collins 2000; Crenshaw 1991).

Embedded into this notion are several concepts such as social context and complexity (Collins and Bilge 2020)
