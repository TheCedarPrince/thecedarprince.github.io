### Materials & Methods

Ten right-handed subjects, five male and five female, participated and gave informed consent. Their mean age was 27.1 years with a standard deviation of 6.7 years.

**Covert attention:** how one can intentionally focus on locations in visual space where stimuli are expected without eye movement.Results in better stimuli processing occurring at the locus of attention while attenuating attention given elsewhere. [1]
