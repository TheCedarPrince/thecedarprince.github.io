  * Does this not add to the overall nature of the Zettelkasten? [1]
  * What sort of topics could this open in the Zettelkasten? Are these topics you are willing to invest into? [1]
  * Where does this new note possibly fit into in the rest of the conversation with your Zettelkasten? [1]
  * Can this information be added to an already existing Zettel or theme? [1]

### Zettel Creation

  * Do you have enough information do write a new zettel?[1]
  * Do you understand the information enough in the zettel you are creating? [1]
