### Goals

1. Record real-time physiological data
2. Measure daily activity to find sleep patterns and reactions to surroundings
3. Create personalized baselines
4. Find differences in health of varying individuals
5. Detect when someone could potentially begin to fall ill

### Population Details

  * 40 people were used for validation testing
  * Participant #1 was tracked 679 days

```
- Nearly 250000 measurements on this person per day
- Only 603 days of records were used
```

### Usage of Wearables

  * Metrics Collected

```
- Heart Rate
- [SpO2](/01112022220843-spo2-explained.md)
- Skin Temperature
```

  * Wearables were shown to:

```
- Detect early signs of Lyme Disease
- Determine an inflammatory response was occurring
```

  * Sensors

```
- HR

### Lyme Disease Found in Subject 1

  * During days 470 - 474 outliers were found in

```
- Abnormally elevated HR
- Abnormally elevated skin temperature 
- Decrease in SpO2
- Congruent with previous studies on nonportable devices [1]
```

  * Coincided with Lyme Disease onset

```
- Detected before typical bull's rash manifestation
- It was reported that SpO2 and HR was most important for alerting of Lyme Disease
- Strong and repeated signals in change of heart algorithm were detected during Lyme Disease
```
