### Motivation

I wanted to know what the different deficiencies exist for study packages in a network study context. This is a small overview of known deficiencies broken down by community.

### Deficiences Found across Communities

#### OHDSI

With standardization across sites using the OMOP CDM, this has dramatically improved the amount of ways [real world data](https://jacobzelko.com/10282021140730-real-world-evidence) can be used across disciplines. With that, the current tools developed within OHDSI for OMOP CDM data analysis are often not sufficient for all desired or imagined analyses. This leads to the need of creating novel tools and resources that each collaboration may require.

[It is additionally suggested that all participating sites record information about the ETL processed used to map any data asset into the OMOP Common Data Model to ensure clear understanding of how data sources are used.](https://jacobzelko.com/05302023185922-study-package-requirements) In practice, I personally do not see this discussion happening very often sadly. It is definitely a point of concern to make this a more regular part of networked studies. [1]

Additionally, when working with claims data, there are [several limitations about claims data](https://jacobzelko.com/06082023203531-claims-data-limitations) to be wary of.
