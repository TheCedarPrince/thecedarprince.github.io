### Algorithm

Let $p_{1} = (x_{1}, y_{1})$, $p_{2} = (x_{2}, y_{2})$, $p = (x_{p}, y_{p})$ where $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are two points of interest and $p$ is either $p_{1}$ or $p_{2}$. The algorithm for determining the line that contains points $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ utilizes the Point-Slope Formula:

$$
y_{2} - y_{1} = m(x_{2} - x_{1})
$$

Can be rewritten such that

$$
m = \frac{ y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}
$$

To define the slope of the line in question. To generalize this to a generic solution, one reevaluates for the point slope formula using $y$ and $x$ as general terms:

$$
y - y_{p} = m(x - x_{p})
$$

To produce the final generic equation, reorganizing yields:

$$
y(x) = \frac{x \cdot \left( y_{2} - y_{1} \right)}{x_{2} - x_{1}} - \frac{x_{p} \cdot \left( y_{2} - y_{1} \right)}{x_{2} - x_{1}} + y_{p}
$$

### Example

```julia
using Plots
gr()

# Utilizing an implicit return from the generic function
y(x, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) = x .* (y_2 - y_1) ./ (x_2 - x_1) .- x_1 .* (y_2 - y_1) ./ (x_2 - x_1) .+ y_1

input = -5:5
output = y(input, 2, -1, 0, 3)

plot(input,
     output, 
     framestyle=:zerolines,
     label="Fitted Line",
     title="Line Fitting Two Points",
     xlim=(-5, 5),
     ylim=(-5, 5)
     )
scatter!((2, -1), label="Point 1", marker=5)
scatter!((0, 3), label="Point 2", marker=5)
```
