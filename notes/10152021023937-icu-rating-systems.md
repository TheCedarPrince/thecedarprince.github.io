This paper was useful as it provided a good overview of intensive care unit scoring systems. It enumerated their characteristics and also talked about their advantages. The paper also went over a variety of scoring systems but as I was concerned with learning what scoring systems in general were, I stopped there.

### What is a Scoring System?

> What is one approach clinical staff in an intensive care unit utilize to predict patient outcomes *and* to improve clinical decisions?


In short, intensive care unit scoring systems!

> What is an intensive care unit scoring system?


These scoring systems (also referred to as severity scales) are calculated alongside traditional diagnosis methods. They are used to: 

1. Predict patient outcomes
2. Compare quality of care
3. Create breakdowns for clinical trials

They are handy for also analyzing unexpected patient outcomes and what precipitated the outcome.

### What Characterizes a Scoring System?

> What is a scoring system comprised of?


A scoring system generally has two components:

1. Score - a number assigned to a given disease based on severity.
2. Probability Model - determines the probability of patient deaths.

> How are scoring system probability models used?


In practice, a model gives clinical decision makers additional insight into comparing patient populations for:

1. Treatment
2. Triage
3. Comparative analysis
4. Understanding treatment effectiveness
5. Optimizing resources

### What Are Characteristics of an Ideal Model?

> What are the three characteristics of an ideal model for scoring?


An ideal model must be:

1. Valid
2. Calibrated
3. Discriminated

> What does it mean for a model to have "validity"?


"Validity" means how well a model performs on test datasets during the model's creation.

> What does a "calibrated" model mean?


The accuracy between estimated mortality probabilities and the actual mortalities experienced by patients. What is key to note is that it is also able to be statistically robust/rigorous. [1] Essentially, is the model well suited to the actual patients being evaluated?

> What does a model that is "discriminatory"?


How well the model can determine what patients live and what patients die in practice. Examples of measures used to understand discriminatory patterns in a model are:

  * Sensitivity
  * Specificity
  * False positive rate
  * False negative rate
  * Positive predictive power
  * Misclassification rate
  * Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and
  * Concordance. [2]
