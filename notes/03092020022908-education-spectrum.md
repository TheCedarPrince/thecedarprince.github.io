My best friend Wesley Samples believes that education – and for that matter, knowledge – falls more along a spectrum than in discrete categories (such as Mathematics and Biology). One can look at biology and find the idea of the golden ratio repeated across nature [1], [2]; example being the *Aeonium Tabuliforme*:

There is the idea of the creature being a biological entity motivating questions such as

  * Why does the Nautilus have a shell like this?
  * What function does it serve?

### Kuhnian Reasoning on Non-Linearity of Education

Beyond Kuhn's general [musing in the _Structure of Scientific Revolutions](/05152022174848-structure-revolutions.md), his thought can also be linked to the notion that science and education is not linear.
