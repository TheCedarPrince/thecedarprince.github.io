### Leading Successful Telehealth Interventions

  * [Keys for Successful Interventions]

[NOTE](https://jacobzelko.com/05022022171845-telehealth-global-emergencies) How to realize a successful telehealth intervention alongside medical professionals according to this paper:

  * Provide telehealth training
  * Create telehealth accreditation
  * Ensure proper funding
  * Structure care models to incorporate telehealth as a core foundation
  * Communicate to all stakeholders the best mode that they will receive
  * Incorporate routine evaluation and management of telehealth interventions

### Background

Telehealth is the remote delivery of healthcare via telecommunication tools [3] and the transferral of medical information between sites via telecommunications to improve patient health. [4] The term telehealth is often used interchangeably with the term "telemedicine" as well [4], [5]

Given this definition, one of the most obvious goals of telehealth is to improve patient health and care. [3] Although this is the obvious and most idealistic goal for telehealth, there are other subtle goals of telehealth. For example, it may be to ease the burden to provider care or to assist with triage [6] or to enable cost savings for health systems or payers. [7]

### Telehealth Strategies or Frameworks

```

### Challenges in Telehealth

[NOTE](https://jacobzelko.com/05022022155118-telehealth) [4]

  * Current Procedural Terminology Codes

```
- Get in the way currently of how individuals get paid for telehealth
- CPT Editorial panel working on this circa 2015
```

  * Interstate licensing and care provision

```
- Federation of State Medical Boards created the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact
	- Ease multistate licensing [8]
	- Not all states involved at the time of publication
```

  * Quality of Care

```
- National Quality Forum developing telehealth framework
	- Telehealth Framework To Support Measure Development 2016 - 2017
		- Developed to identify existing and potential telehealth metrics
```

[NOTE](https://jacobzelko.com/05022022171845-telehealth-global-emergencies)

  * Clinician unwillingness to use telehealth [9]

```
- Despite high funding in Australia, less than 1% of specialist consultations were telehealth-based [10]
- Clinicians must see telehealth interventions as normal [9]
```

  * Renumeration is important but is not the only thing that leads to a successful telehealth intervention
  * Some care cannot be provided remotely

```
- Such as lab tests
- Some physical examinations
```

[NOTE](https://jacobzelko.com/05022022144808-state-of-telehealth)

  * Reimbursement issues

```
- Eligible for clinical facilities where shortage of health professionals (get citation)
```

  * Lack of socialization

```
- The digital divide [11]
	- Difference of access to telehealth based on:
		- Geography 
		- Social factors
	- Worst for the elderly
		- Only 58% of persons > 65 years old use Internet [12]
```

### Opportunities for Telehealth

[NOTE](https://jacobzelko.com/05022022171845-telehealth-global-emergencies)

  * Advantages of telehealth

```
- Activate large number of care providers at once
- Enable better triage
- Provide care services when provider locations are unavailable
- Reduce person-to-person contact of disease transmission
```

[NOTE](https://jacobzelko.com/05022022144808-state-of-telehealth)

  * Chronic condition patients

```
- Elderly Americans 
	- ~2 million elderly that are homebound [13]
	- Medical home will be patient's home for best patient-centered care [14]
```

  * Acute care patients

```
- Stroke [15]
- Pneumonia [16]
```
