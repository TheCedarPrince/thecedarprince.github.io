Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnetic field to realign hydrogen atoms in the body. The realignment generates a magnetic field which is detected and rendered into a 3D image. Yields clearer contrasts between tissues compared to [CT scans](https://jacobzelko.com/12302020173101-computed-tomography). [1]
