Each week, you should hold a 30 minute-ish weekly review to guarantee each project on the [project list](/03192020050207-gtd-implementation.md) has at least one upcoming next action for the week. 

Utilize a [trigger list](/03192020050346-trigger-list.md) to help make sure you did not miss anything. The trigger list should be custom to whatever it is that you are working on or are responsible for.
