### Notes from Giulia Da Poian's mini lecture:

  * The radius of similarity is technically 0.15(standard deviation of the time series)
  * Generally people choose the radius of similarity to be 0.15 in practice
  * The pattern usually chosen for MSE is 2 points

Entropy Equation:

$$
S = \frac{log(A)}{log(B)}
$$
