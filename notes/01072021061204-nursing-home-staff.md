### Insights into Nurses' Lives & Pandemic

A survey from 2012 notes that 19% of nursing assistants and 13% of RNs hold a second job. [1]

A study by New York State concluded nursing home workers were likely the main source of transmission in nursing homes.Roughly one-quarter of nursing home workers in the state tested positive for the virus. [2]

### Relationship between Presence and Nursing Home Staff

Geolocation data from 501,503 smartphones was observed in at least one nursing home across the US.5.1% who spend > 1hr in a nursing home were found to spend > 1 hr in at least one other nursing home. Directly followed the 11-week period after the March 13th nationwide restriction on nursing home visitors.

Staff working across multiple nursing homes locations were three times likely to be infected than single home staff. [3]
