### Issues regarding the adoption of the spacing effect into classroom settings.

  * The spacing effect has not been studied in recent years
  * The spacing effect is still relatively new
  * The spacing effect does not have any thing to do with current issues educators face.
  * The spacing effect has yet to be shown well in school activities.
  * There are gaps in literature about the spacing effect
  * School-based studies do not show the spacing effect.
  * The spacing effect has not been well demonstrated in a classroom setting
  * Not enough is known about practical class implementation to warrant application of the spacing effect
  * The spacing effect is not well comprehended

These are the most concerning issues concerning usage of the spacing effect:

1. Ahistorical character of research on the spacing effect
2. Some failures to obtain the effect with school-like activities
3. Paucity of impressive classroom demonstrations of the phenomenon
4. Limited knowledge of classroom practice
5. Incomplete understanding of the psychological bases of the spacing effect

**Probably the most legitimate barrier to utilization of the spacing effect in educational settings is the scarcity of in class demonstrations of its usage.**

However, these four issues are not considered as such strong impediments to the implementation of the spacing effect in classroom settings:

1. Is not new and has been studied
2. Continues to receive recent documentation
3. Can assist in addressing educational issues
4. Is demonstrated to lend itself well to school-like activities

### Miscellaneous Concepts

**Lag effects** are believed to occur when performance on a memory task improves as the number of intervening items between successive presentations increases.

**Jost's Law:** If two memories are equal in how well they were learned but at differing times, the older memory will gain more out of a review than the new one. [1]
