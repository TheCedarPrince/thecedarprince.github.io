### Definitions

**Combinatorial Data** - data stored in a graph

**Attribute data** - the data that would be put into a data frame

### Limitations of the Data Frame

  * Does not record relationships between entities
  * Analogous to the `FOREIGN KEY` concept in SQL

### Conclusions

#### Use Cases for Acsets

  * Act as a unifying abstract data type
  * Particularly useful for graphs and data frames, data structures
  * Enables creation of novel data structures

#### Category Theory

  * The category theory for acsets is well understood
  * Opens possibility of implementation of

```
- Limits
- Colimits
- Functorial data migration
```

### Discussion with Brighton Ancelin - October 6, 2021

  * Combinatorial data could be thought of the data that:

```
- Exists solely within a graph structure
- Defines vertices in a graph structure
- Defines edges in a graph structure
- Set of all vertices and set of all edges are isomorphic
	- As long as edge-vertex relationships are maintained
```

  * Attribute data has something concrete that describes it apart from a graph structure

```
- Encodes symmetries or relationships in data that are important to that data
```

### Questions

  * What are the "new data structures" that could be developed with this implementation
  * Why are attribute data combined in the same structure housing combinatorial data?
  * With the snippet of `add_part!`, what is a "part"?
