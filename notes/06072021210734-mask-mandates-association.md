### Definitions and Background

**State-issued mask mandates:** Required to wear masks at:

1. Outside home
2. Businesses and food establishments.

**State-issued restaurant closures:** Restaurants not operating or restricting service to takeout, curbside pickup, or delivery. 

**Providing indoor or outdoor on-premises dining:** State lifting a restaurant closure. No distinction was made on how restaurants reopened (such as with reduced capacity, enhanced sanitation, etc.). Per states, if a bar served food, it was coded as a restaurant and if a bar did not serve food, there were bars.

### Equations

(1) Daily growth rate : 

$$
\ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - \ln(cumulative cases or deaths)_{day} - 1 * 100
$$

### Methods

Analyses were weighted by county population; standard errors were robust to heteroscedasticity; clustered by state. 

Relationship between policies and COVID-19 measured 1–20 days prior to implementation compared with seven mutually exclusive time ranges post-implementation. Associations were examined 60 - 41 and 40 - 21 days before implementation and 1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days after implementation.

COVID-19 case and death growth rates were compared via weighted least-squares regression with county and day fixed effects. Four regression models were used for associating mandates and COVID-19 growth rates by controlling for:

  * Restaurant closures in mask mandate models
  * Mask mandates in the restaurant reopening models
  * Bar closures
  * Stay-at-home orders
  * Bans on gatherings of >= 10 persons
  * Daily COVID-19 tests per 100000 persons
  * County
  * Day

*QUESTION: I wonder how they controlled for these covariate variables?*

### Results

Decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates over these day ranges post-mask mandate implementation were seen:

  * 1 - 20
  * 21 - 40
  * 41 - 60
  * 61 - 80
  * 81 - 100

Permitting on-premises dining saw increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates

  * 41 - 60
  * 61 - 80
  * 81 - 100

days after reopening.

Increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates were observed

  * 61 - 80
  * 81 - 100

days after reopening.

During March 1–December 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied in 2,313 (73.6%) of the 3,142 U.S. counties. Post mask mandate COVID case growth rates:

  * 1 - 20 days: -0.5% (p = 0.02)
  * 21 - 40 days: -1.1% (p < 0.01 for all)
  * 41 - 60 days: -1.5% (p < 0.01 for all)
  * 61 - 80 days: -1.7% (p < 0.01 for all)
  * 81 -100 days: -1.8% (p < 0.01 for all)

Post mask mandate COVID death growth rates:

  * 1 - 20 days: -0.7% (p = 0.03)
  * 21 - 40 days: -1.0% (p < 0.01 for all)
  * 41 - 60 days: -1.4% (p < 0.01 for all)
  * 61 - 80 days: -1.6% (p < 0.01 for all)
  * 81 -100 days: -1.9% (p < 0.01 for all)

*QUESTION: Oh so does this suggest that it took about 20 days before we started to see the lagging effects of these mandates?*

After > 40 days on-premises dining was permitted, increases in case and death growth rates were observed. Possible explanations:

  * Restaurants may have delayed reopening after on-premises dining allowed
  * Restaurant patrons cautious at reopen but grew bolder as time passed.

### Limitations

1. Models not control for other policies like: other types of business closures, physical distancing recommendations, policies issued by localities, and county-level policy variances.
2. Policy compliance and enforcement not explored.
3. No differentiating indoor and outdoor dining, ventilation, and following physical distancing and occupancy not investigated.
