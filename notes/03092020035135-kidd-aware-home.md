### What Is an Aware Home?

In short, an Aware Home is "a living laboratory for research in ubiquitous computing for everyday activities." The home at Georgia Institute of Technology was built to enable researchers ready access to explore the home and implement technologies to monitor individuals going throughout the home â€“ these same technologies, the hope is, would be implement in actual people's homes across the world.

### Applications

Some of the ideas for potential use from the home was to:

  * Support the elderly
  * Find lost objects
  * Monitor specific parts of the house (front door, kitchen, etc.)

This would be using a technology known as [*Context-Aware Applications*](/03092020071146-context-aware) (click for more information).
