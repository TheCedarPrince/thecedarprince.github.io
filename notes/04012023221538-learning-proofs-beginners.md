### Motivation

As I am personally moving into applied mathematics for my future graduate studies, I realized I had a deficiency. And that deficiency?  How to prove things! "Proof" was always a somewhat scary thing that I encountered in mathematics every once in a while – but at the same time exciting. So, this post aims to allay these fears once and for all!

### Project Goals

This process is adapted from the [Ultralearning framework posited by Scott Young](https://jacobzelko.com//07082020163004-ultralearning).

#### What Am I Doing?

Gain an undergraduate level of understanding of proofs and proof creation on par with maths and computer science students.

      * Contrapositive, Converse, and Negation of Conditional Statements
  * Quantifiers

### Roadmap

This is based on the Meta Learning step Young described as well as some additional tweaks of my own:

  * **Outcomes:** The knowledge and abilities you’ll need to acquire for success.
  * **Topic:** The topic to learn
  * **Done:** If this task has been completed (X) or not yet (cell is empty)

This table describes the very broad topics, resources I'll use, and the expected learning outcomes for each topic.  As I progress through this table, I will add an "X" to each row I have studied. Furthermore, the table is ordered by level of difficulty.

This table gets more into exact topics and concepts to master. They have an associated difficult level and overall topic. Moreover, this a synthesis of concepts and topics to be covered based on class syllabi from:

  * MA307: Introduction to Proof (taught by Dan Dugger at University of Oregon)
  * 300:T6 Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning (taught by Chloe Urbanski Wawrzyniak at Rutgers University)
  * Introduction to Proof-based Discrete Mathematics (taught by Matthew Gelvin at University of Chicago)
  * MATH 301: Introduction To Proofs (taught by Emily Riehl at John Hopkins University)

Additionally, in the construction of this project, I'd like to thank John Carlos Baez for some of his suggestions!
