### Summary

This was a summary paper detailing how to establish an All-Payers Claim Database with recommendations from 8 states across the US with All-Payer Claims Databases. It was a high value paper! Lots of great insights in this document with good summary insights from across the states interviewed which were:

  * Arkansas
  * Colorado
  * Maine
  * Minnesota
  * New Hampshire
  * Utah
  * Virginia
  * Wisconsin

However, the general insights were rather vague about what states actually *did* with their APCD. This paper gains even more benefit when read in conjunction with [Part 2 of this series](/08062021145920-benefits-state-apcds.md).

### Intended Uses of All-Payers Claim Databases

**Information transparency** is disclosing and highlighting variation in:

  * utilization
  * cost
  * service quality

Enables employers to choose value-based care. Consumers will know what options they have.

### Recommendations for States in Creating All-Payers Claim Databases

  * [General Recommendations](/08032021211415-apcd-recommendations.md)
  * [Virginia All-Payers Claim Database](/08032021211753-virginia-apcd.md)

### Potential Ways an All-Payers Claim Database Can Be Used

An All-Payers Claim Database can be used as a state oversight tool for:

1. Insurance markets
2. Public coverage programs
3. Public health.

It can also be used as a research tool for health care research and system improvement
