CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:

  * Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
  * Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
  * Stay home when you are sick.
  * Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
  * Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
  * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
  * If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
