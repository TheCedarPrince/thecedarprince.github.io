### Structural Vulnerabilities to Individuals Suffering from IDD

> This problem is directly related to *The Social Determinants of Health* [1] [NOTE](07112020161337-social-determinants-health.md]


IDD adults are vulnerable [2] and have an elevated rate of underlying conditions critical to be considered during the pandemic.

Adults with IDD experience higher rates of living with others, lower socioeconomic status, [3] and poor medical care access. [4]

The U.S. tends to erroneously list IDD an underlying cause of death. [5] In 2017, 56.9% of U.S. IDD adults who had pneumonia as an underlying or contributing cause of death had IDD recorded as their underlying cause of death.

Provider organizations and their care staff - generally from impoverished populations - serving IDD adults have been chronically underfunded.  [6], [7]
