### Setting Up Environment

#### Installation Requirements

We install the OHDSI dummy database, `Eunomia`, to write our queries:

```R
install.packages(c("SqlRender", "DatabaseConnector", "remotes"))
remotes::install_github("ohdsi/Eunomia", ref = "v1.0.0")
```

We will also install the package `knitr` for viewing and working with resulting tables easily:

```R
install.packages("knitr")
```

#### Making Connection to Eunomia

Here we load the `DatabaseConnector` library to connect to `Eunomia`: 

```R
library('DatabaseConnector')
library('knitr')
```

And set a connection to Eunomia

```R
connectionDetails <-Eunomia::getEunomiaConnectionDetails()
connection <- connect(connectionDetails)
```

#### Querying Drugs by Name

First we need to write our SQL query as follows:

```R
sql <-	"
	SELECT * FROM @cdm.concept WHERE lower(concept_name) = 'warfarin'
	"
```

And then we can run our SQL query and return the results as follows:

```
result <- renderTranslateQuerySql(connection, sql,cdm ="main")
knitr::kable(result)
```
