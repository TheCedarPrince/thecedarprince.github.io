Today, I spent some time learning about DrWatson.jl. I have always wanted to use the project and now I finally have a reason to work with it! I enjoyed the default layout provided by DrWatson - here are some general thoughts on the matter.

The project directory provided by DrWatson is automatically setup. The defaults are quite nice and I did not change anything except for ignoring the data files:

```
│projectdir          <- Project's main folder. It is initialized as a Git
│                       repository with a reasonable .gitignore file.
│
├── _research        <- WIP scripts, code, notes, comments,
│   |                   to-dos and anything in an alpha state.
│   └── tmp          <- Temporary data folder.
│
├── data             <- **Immutable and add-only!**
│   ├── sims         <- Data resulting directly from simulations.
│   ├── exp_pro      <- Data from processing experiments.
│   └── exp_raw      <- Raw experimental data.
│
├── plots            <- Self-explanatory.
├── notebooks        <- Jupyter, Weave or any other mixed media notebooks.
│
├── papers           <- Scientific papers resulting from the project.
│
├── scripts          <- Various scripts, e.g. simulations, plotting, analysis,
│   │                   The scripts use the `src` folder for their base code.
│   └── intro.jl     <- Simple file that uses DrWatson and uses its greeting.
│
├── src              <- Source code for use in this project. Contains functions,
│                       structures and modules that are used throughout
│                       the project and in multiple scripts.
│
├── README.md        <- Optional top-level README for anyone using this project.
├── .gitignore       <- by default ignores _research, data, plots, videos,
│                       notebooks and latex-compilation related files.
│
├── Manifest.toml    <- Contains full list of exact package versions used currently.
└── Project.toml     <- Main project file, allows activation and installation.
                        Includes DrWatson by default.
```

I started DrWatson up in my Julia REPL and ran the following as I already had a git repo set-up and files in the repo:

```julia
using DrWatson
initialize_project("NeuriViz"; authors = ["Jacob Zelko", "Zachary P Christensen"], force = false, git = false, placeholder = true)
```

It set up the structure I needed and was quite easy to use. DrWatson was created by George Datseris.
