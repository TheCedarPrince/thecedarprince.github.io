### Overview

The goal of APCDs is to improve affordability of healthcare, its efficiency, and cost transparency. [1]

All-payer claims databases: State databases which contain the following information on private and public payers:

  * Medical claims
  * Pharmacy claims
  * Dental claims
  * Eligibility and provider files

Insurers are usually mandated by the state to provide APCD data to States.

### Advantages of APCDs over other federal health datasets

APCDs contain private insurance. This is not common for other datasets.

APCDs contain data from most or all insurance companies in a State. Other datasets do not have them.

APCDs include info on care for patients across care sites rather than only from discharge data systems. APCDs include large sample sizes, geographic representation, and capture of longitudinal information on a wide range of individual patients.
