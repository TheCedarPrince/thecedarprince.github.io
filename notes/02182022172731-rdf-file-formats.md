There are many different file storage formats for RDF reified data.

### What Is the Turtle Format?

The Turtle format (file extension `.ttl`) is one example of a storage format. It takes the following form:

```
<Subject> <Predicate> <Resource> .
```

#### What Is an Example of the Turtle Format?

If I have the statement:

> The sky is colored blue.


That can be written in the form:

```
<sky> <is colored> <blue> .
```

### What Is the XML Format?

Another example is utilizing the popular XML format for representing RDF data.

#### What Is an Example of the XML Format?

If I have the statement:

> The sky is colored blue.


That can be written in the form:

```xml
<rdf:RDF
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
    xmlns:j.0="http://some.fakeurl.com/fake/is " > 
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="sky">
    <j.0:colored rdf:resource="blue"/>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
```
