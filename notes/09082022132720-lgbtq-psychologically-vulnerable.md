### Reading Motivation

I examined this paper at the time to find out more about vulnerabilities posed to LGBTQ populations. I was less interested in the pandemic's potential impacts on these populations although this paper did have many thoughts on the topic.

### LGBTQ Risks

The LGBTQ community faces significant mental health disparities compared to heterosexual, cisgender populations (Pl√∂derl & Tremblay, 2015; Price-Feeney, Green, & Dorison, 2020; Russell & Fish, 2016)

People of color within the LGBTQ community are at greater risk for social inequality (Baams, Wilson, & Russell, 2019; Conron & Wilson, 2019; Movement Advancement Project & SAGE, 2017; Morton et al., 2018; Whittington et al., 2020).

Intersectional LGBTQ youth populations (e.g. stratified by race, ethnicity, immigration status, poverty conditions, etc.) generally engage more often with school mental health services (Ali et al., 2019; Golberstein, Wen, & Miller, 2020).
