### Motivation

[I was motivated to write this thought while writing my review on Marshall MacLuhan's masterpiece, *Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man*, while ruminating on his idea that I refer to as the "action and reaction".](//05222022225241-understanding-media-extensions.md) [It feels as though there exists an analogy between Einstein's notion of relativity of simultaneity and MacLuhan's idea concept of "action and reaction" â€“ this note attempts to explain that analogous relationship.](//12242022211924-simultaneity-relativity.md)

### 

  * Relativity of Simultaneity recap

```
- Include Gif like this: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Relativity_of_Simultaneity_Animation.gif?1671940684539
```

  * Recap action and reaction idea
  * Discuss analogy

```
- How information from Einstein's concept is received relative to time
- How action and reaction occurs simultaneously
- How knowledge dissemination and uptake can change over time 
	- Some will be ready to use the knowledge 
	- Others will be slow to adapt 
-
