### Motivation

Collaboration in network studies are often quite thorough and involved. This looks at how different communities encourage and participate within network studies.

### Site Collaboration across Specific Communities

#### OHDSI

  * Site participation is voluntary

      * No obligations
  * Data from all participating sites remain at the site

      * Only aggregate results shared across sites
      * No patient level pooling happens across sites
