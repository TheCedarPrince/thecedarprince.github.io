An overview of how telehealth interventions could and should be deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Really excellent read in my opinion that goes beyond just the COVID-19 pandemic but rather can be taken and applied elsewhere in the telehealth landscape. In particular, their conclusions were interesting as well as their discussion on clinician unwillingness.

### Systems for Telehealth Interventions

  * NATO created Multinational Telemedicine System in 2000
  * American Telemedicine Association Emergency and Response framework and infrastructure checklist [1]

### Challenges to Telehealth

  * Clinician unwillingness to use telehealth [2]

```
- Despite high funding in Australia, less than 1% of specialist consultations were telehealth-based [3]
- Clinicians must see telehealth interventions as normal [2]
```

  * Renumeration is important but is not the only thing that leads to a successful telehealth intervention
  * Some care cannot be provided remotely

```
- Such as lab tests
- Some physical examinations
```

### Opportunities for Telehealth

  * Advantages of telehealth

```
- Activate large number of care providers at once
- Enable better triage
- Provide care services when provider locations are unavailable
- Reduce person-to-person contact of disease transmission
```

### Concluding Thoughts

How to realize a successful telehealth intervention alongside medical professionals according to this paper:

  * Provide telehealth training
  * Create telehealth accreditation
  * Ensure proper funding
  * Structure care models to incorporate telehealth as a core foundation
  * Communicate to all stakeholders the best mode that they will receive
  * Incorporate routine evaluation and management of telehealth interventions
