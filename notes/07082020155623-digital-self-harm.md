Digital Self Harm is any online communication and activity that leads to, supports, or exacerbates non-suicidal yet intentional harm or impairment of an individual’s physical wellbeing. It includes consuming and generating online content. Digital self-harm occurs when a person’s behaviors are negatively influenced through his or her online activities in such a manner that these online activities lead to the infliction of non-suicidal direct or indirect physical harm to oneself. 

Digital self-harm is believed to be growing at a rate that will not stop without check. [1]
