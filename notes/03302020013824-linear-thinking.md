I am not in full agreement that learning material should normally be presented in a linear fashion as the brain itself is not ordered generally in a linear fashion but rather a global and far-reaching format. My question is global learning a more effective presentation of knowledge type than linear learning? This thought was inspired by *How to Take Smart Notes* [1] 

This idea is also linked to the idea of [Education as a Spectrum](/03092020022908-education-spectrum.md).
