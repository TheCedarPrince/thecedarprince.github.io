### Motivation

I wanted to collect general thoughts and insights about code quality of study packages as I find them. 

### Code Review

The code used in a network package should be reviewed that it performs as expected. This can be done by testing it within one's own local environment and that the study runs as expected. Additionally, any generated results from the study should be reviewed by clinical experts and stakeholders to ensure the accuracy of results generated from a given study package.
