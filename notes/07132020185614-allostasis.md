Allostasis is the ability to achieve stability through change (such as the processes leading to disease). It broadens the concept of homeostasis. [1]

Allostatic load is damage to the body caused by stress.

The allostatic load hypothesis links one's psychosocial environment and physical disease via neuroendocrine pathways.

It is particularly pertinent to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, cognitive decline, and has been described as a sign of accelerated ageing. [1]
