### Motivation

The Book of OHDSI, to quote my friend and mentor Kristin Kostka, is "an act of God" that it came to be in how thorough and useful a resource it is for the OHDSI community. Over the past couple years, I have read multiple parts of this book over and over again for my work and research. In general, this book is a useful resource for OHDSI but I do find it to be sometimes limited in utility for the greater observational health community. These are my notes on the book along with various commentary.

### Background

Here we aim to provide a general step­by­step guide to the design and implementation of an observational study with the OHDSI tools Note: In this case, this is the critical flaw of this book when tells i y about studies. It limits itself to only thinking within the context of the available HADES Tools when there is SO much more going on!
