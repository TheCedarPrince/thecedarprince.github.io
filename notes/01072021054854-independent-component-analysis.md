ICA seeks to minimize mutual information between projections.Independent component analysis finds a coordinate frame onto which the projection of the data has minimal temporal overlap. [1]

ICA is considered a linear decomposition alternative to principal component analysis (PCA). In PCA, the data is represented using perpendicular axes. ICA is not limited by this constraint [2]

ICA has been applied to domains such as:

  * fMRI
  * performing speech
  * noise separation [3]

ICA decompositions are best for sources linearly mixed in a recorded signal.
