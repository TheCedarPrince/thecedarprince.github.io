Reduction of non-response bias through the introduction of new weighting techniques. [1] *QUESTION: What is non-response bias and how do you adjust for that?*

### How Reliability and Validity Were Measured

High reliable papers included:

  * Conducted reliability tests using repeated test/retest measures
  * Used multiple samples/populations
  * Used multiple time periods.
  * Ran statistical tests

How authors achieved higher validity by:

  * Comparing BRFSS to physical measures.

### Conclusions

Self-report on chronic conditions between BRFSS and surveys are highly reliable.

As time between conducting the same survey lapses, reliability for some questions decrease when re-asked. [2]

Sometimes, self-reports from the BRFSS were very reliable but prevalence differed. *QUESTION: What does it mean when self-reports are highly reliable and prevalence rates still differ? Seems really strange and I am not sure why this would happen...*

Similarities between BRFSS and other surveys using self-reports persisted across different modes of reporting like phone calls or in-person interviews. Researchers observed BRFSS reliability and validity for some cohorts but not for others. [3]

All surveys consistently showed the proportion of respondents indicating general health to be "excellent" was declining. *RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY*

BRFSS physical activity measures and responses were compared sometimes to physical device measures.Prevalence variation estimates found occasionally; trends similar when comparing survey results over time. *QUESTION: Interesting how with devices prevalences did vary but trends were found to be similar across demographics. I wonder what reports did that? I'll stick a pin in this for now.*
