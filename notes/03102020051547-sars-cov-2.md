### What is SARS-CoV-2?

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a [betacoronavirus](/03102020054429-coronavirus-definition), like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.

Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. [1]

Currently, the World Health Organization has not classified this situation as a pandemic though this stance is highly contentious. [2]

UPDATE (MARCH 11th):_ As of now, this situation is now classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization. [3]

Here is an image showing its transmission across the world:

#### Symptoms

The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure (this is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus]) [4]:

  * Fever
  * Cough
  * Shortness of breath

#### [**Risk of dying:**](/03102020052237-covid19-dying)

1 - 2% is the current estimate though it could get higher. [5]

#### [**Prevention Methods:**](/03102020053006-cdc-respiratory-preventions)

  * Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
  * Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
  * Stay home when you are sick.
  * Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
  * Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
  * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
  * If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
