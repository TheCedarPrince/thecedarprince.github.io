The weekly plan is very similar to the [monthly plan](/03192020013347-bullet-journal-month.md) but is on a much smaller scale. If anything, it is much more similar to a weekly planner with an added twist of being an exercise in reflection and journaling. The weekly plan comprises of two main parts being:

1. Preview - where you plan for the week ahead
2. Review - where you reflect on the previous week

### Layout

Generally, it is very brief and contains the following:

1. Major to-do's of the week
2. Major events of the week marked on corresponding day
3. Review of the previous week in a short form journal

Also, one could also include something like a [habit tracking system](/03192020013347-bullet-journal-month.md) for each week as well.

### Preview

Here is encompassed the first two points being:

1. Major to-do's of the week
2. Major events of the week marked on corresponding day

This is where you schedule each day of the week based on your schedule. One can use the ["Next Actions" and "Waiting For"](/03192020050207-gtd-implementation.md) list from the [GTD framework](/03192020045854-get-things-done.md) to plan out your to-do's in a much more structured and useful way.

### Review

Here is where the last point of the layout comes in - a reflection in the form of a [short form journal](/03192020035441-bullet-journal-daily.md##Short-Form-Journaling-Symbols). This is meant to be a brief professional reflection on the week and to reflect on the:

  * Wins for the week
  * What could have been better
  * How you are going to improve next week
