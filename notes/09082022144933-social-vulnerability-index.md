SVI data can be retrieved from: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html

For at least the 2000 version of SVI, the metric is derived from summed percentile rankings at census tract level of fifteen U.S. Census variables shown in the following table: 

| SVI Theme                     | Variables Included                        |

These variables were determined from an extensive literature review [19,20,23,29, 30]. <!–TODO: Get references from [this file](/09082022132106-spatial-vulnerability-outcomes.md)–> The SVI is normalized between 0 and 1 with 0 representing low social vulnerability and 1 representing high social vulnerability.
