  * Cash amounts, procedure codes, diagnosis codes, etc do not contain punctuation

```

```

#### Eligibility File

  * Does not contain information about education level
  * Standard requires subscriber confidential information

```

```

```
- Not immediately apparent on how to classify subscribers across income
- How to do analysis of income vs cost of care?
	- Is cost of care fair for them?
```

#### Medical Files

  * Payer claim control number (PCCN) seems to put a ratchet in the plans of versioning
  * How often is it that patient modifiers are not useful?
