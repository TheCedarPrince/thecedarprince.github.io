### Pathogenesis of SARS-Coronavirus

The virus replicates in the lower respiratory tract. This is followed by an innate and a specific immune response. Viral factors and immune response (e.g. cytokine dysregulation) play a role in pathogenesis. [1]

**Stage 1:** Diffuse alveolar damage occurs, macrophage and T-cell infiltration, and type 2 pneumocyte proliferation manifests which can appear patchy on a chest X-ray. [1]

**Stage 2:** Organisation occurs with the infection not entirely limited to the pulmonary system. The virus replicates in enterocytes resulting in diarrhoea. It is shed in the stool, urine, and possibly other body fluids. [1]

The virus is shed from the respiratory tract during acute infection. The virus may continue to be shed for some time from the gastrointestinal tract after recovery. [1]
