### Motivation

This note works as an overview on how to develop and revise robust cohorts within the context of observational health research.

### Cohort Review

  * Review associated literature
  * Inquire on advice from relevant clinical and technical experts
  * Use the [Phenotype Workflow](https://jacobzelko.com/01102023212115-computable-phenotypes) to more clearly understand how to powerfully build a cohort based on a cohort

### Cohort Management

A disease definition library could be of great benefit to standardize how cohorts are generated consistently in a network study context. An example is the PhenotypeLibrary initiative from within OHDSI.
