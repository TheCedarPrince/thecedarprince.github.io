### History of Virus

Coronavirus disease was discovered in 1931 and the first human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, was isolated in 1965. [1] Since then, three main groups of coronavirus have been identified. The following grouping only accounts for types affecting humans [2]:

Group 1: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 Group 2: HCoVOC43, HCoV-HKU1 Group 3: No human CoVs found

### Clinical Picture

All human coronaviruses have been reported worldwide. Infections occur throughout the year though most frequently in winter and spring. Larger outbreaks tend to occur every 2 - 4 years. [2] One is often infected with coronavirus early in life. Being infected with one strain does not yield protection against others. Immunity to the same virus does not last long. Reinfection can occur within a few months. [1]

Coronavirae are a common cause of the cold, causing about 2–10% infections across the world. Infections in adults usually experience symptoms of rhinitis, sore throat and sometimes coughing. Asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic lung disease sufferers may experience a worsening of underlying illness from coronavirus. [2]

Coronavirus is acquired via air-borne particles (fecal matter, droplets, etc.) upon inhalation by an individual. The coronavirus enters the respiratory system. From there, it multiplies in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. It then spreads to the lower respiratory tract. [2]
