### Materials and Methods

EEGs from 128 tin electrodes, referenced to the nose. Data acquired at 500 Hz (pass band of DC, 100 Hz), impedances &lt; 10 KOhms, and interelectrode spacing at 2.4 cm. Eye position monitored with electrooculographic recordings from the external canthi. Eye movements and artifacts were removed off-line.

*QUESTION: How was it referenced to the nose?  QUESTION: What is an electrooculographic recording? QUESTION: Where is the external canthi?*
