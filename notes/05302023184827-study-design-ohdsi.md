### Motivation

These are some best practices found across a variety of resources that describe how to structure an observational health study.

### Things To Do

  * Pre-specify elements of an observational study such as its:

      * Design
      * Parameters

### Things To Avoid

  * Do not evolve your approach for a desired result

      * This can happen consciously or unconsciously
      * Known as p-hacking
      * Real world data can give the feeling of limitless opportunities

          * Could lead to unclear lines of inquiry
          * Difficult to explain
          * Harder to reproduce

The above avoidance suggestions does have some strong caveats however. In the context of a network study, there exists a tension between the idealized, "in theory" idea of a study design and the "in practice" study design. In practice, an idealized design may fail, not scientifically, but due to implementation details that were not foreseen. Furthermore, when considering an international audience, there could even be a serious design failure when not considering regional or country level differences.
