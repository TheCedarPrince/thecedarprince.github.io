One such sharply divisive word is the verb "mansplain," coined by Rebecca Solnit

Mansplaining is not just when a man explains something to a woman in a patronizing way. It is when they do it despite there being clear signs that the woman already knows it and possibly knows it better than they do, which fits into a pattern that many women experience across their whole lives, of society generally assuming that men are more knowledgeable than women
