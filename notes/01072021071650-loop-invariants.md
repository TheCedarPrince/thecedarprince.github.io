**Loop Invariant:** a statement which explains why an algorithm is correct. [1]

It is comprised of three steps: Initialization: The statement is valid before the first iteration of the loop. Maintenance: If it is true before a loop iteration, it remains true throughout the loop. Termination: At the loop's end, the invariant yields a property to aid in showing the algorithm works expectedly.
