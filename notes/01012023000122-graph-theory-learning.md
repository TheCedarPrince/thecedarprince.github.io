### Motivation

I have always found graph theory interesting ever since I was exposed to it back in my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech. I found out about it through SIR Modeling but personally found the structure of graphs far more fascinating than its application to SIR models. Furthermore, as I intend to be pursuing graduate studies in applied mathematics, why not get started with trying to understand it?

### Project Goals

This process is adapted from the [Ultralearning framework posited by Scott Young](/07082020163004-ultralearning.md).

#### What Am I Doing?

Gain an undergraduate level of understanding of graph theory on par with maths and computer science students.
