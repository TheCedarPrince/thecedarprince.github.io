### Motivation

I have always found graph theory interesting ever since I was exposed to it back in my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech. I found out about it through SIR Modeling but personally found the structure of graphs far more fascinating than its application to SIR models. Furthermore, as I intend to be pursuing graduate studies in applied mathematics, why not get started with trying to understand it?

### Project Goals

This process is adapted from the [Ultralearning framework posited by Scott Young](/07082020163004-ultralearning.md).

#### What Am I Doing?

Gain an undergraduate level of understanding of graph theory on par with maths and computer science students.

This table describes the very broad topics, resources I'll use, and the expected learning outcomes for each topic.  As I progress through this table, I will add an "X" to each row I have studied. Furthermore, the table is ordered by level of difficulty with "Definition of a graph and its components" being the first topic I should learn and "Graphs and geometry" being the more advanced topics I should study. The topics and resources here are based on [1] and [2] with potentially more resources to add in the future.
