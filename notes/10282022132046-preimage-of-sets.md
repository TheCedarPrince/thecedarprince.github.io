### Reading Motivation

As I have learned and understood what [images](//10152022173643-image-of-sets.md) are, I am now on my quest to learn what preimages so that I can understand the concept of bundles!

### Basics on the Preimage of a Subset

Given some function $f : A \rightarrow B$ and the subsets $C \subseteq A$ and $D \subseteq B$, then the preimage (or inverse image of a set) is:

$$
f^{-1}(D) = \{x \in A : f(x) \in D\}
$$

Which has the interesting property that the image of each element in $D$ is in $C$.

For some reason, admittedly, this was more challenging for me to understand than the image of a subset.  Why that is, I do not know; maybe my brain has a bit of a challenge thinking in reverse?  Personally, I find imagining the notation of the definition more easily followed when it is written like this: 

$$
f^{-1}(D) = \{x \in A : f(x) = D\}
$$

Notice the subtle notation change I introduced where I said $=$ instead of $\in$ which, although interchangeable here, reads more clearly in my mind. Essentially, you say the condition for this set to be any element, $x$, that satisfies the equation, $f(x) = D$. To me, my brain translates that condition into a fun challenge rather than an abstract $\in D$ which reads less concretely.

#### Example

Let $X = \R$, $Y = \R$, $V = \{1, 4, 9, 16, 25\}$ which we know the fact that $V \subseteq Y$, and $f : x \rightarrow x^{2}$.

Using the definition:

$$
f^{-1}(V) = \{x \in X : f(x) \in V\}
$$

We can create a few equations that can help us generating the set:

$$
x^{2} = 1
$$

$$
x^{2} = 4
$$

$$
x^{2} = 9
$$

$$
x^{2} = 16
$$

$$
x^{2} = 25
$$

And solving these equations gives the following solutions:

$$
x^{2} = 1; x = \pm 1
$$

$$
x^{2} = 4; x = \pm 2
$$

$$
x^{2} = 9; x = \pm 3
$$

$$
x^{2} = 16; x = \pm 4
$$

$$
x^{2} = 25; x = \pm 5
$$

And we can write our solution to the inverse image of the set $V$ being the following:

$$
\{-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5\}
$$
