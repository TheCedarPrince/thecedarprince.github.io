"Divide-and-Conquer": an algorithm design paradigm comprised of three steps [1]: 

1. Break a problem into smaller subproblems
2. Recursively evaluate subproblems
3. Combine subproblem solutions to one solution for the original problem.

One example of this paradigm is [Merge Sort](/12192020184204-merge-sort.md).
