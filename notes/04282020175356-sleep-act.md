### Psalm 5 Scripture

```
Listen to my words, Lord, 
consider my lament. 
Hear my cry for help,
my King and my God,
for to you I pray.

In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice;
in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.

[...]

But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
    let them ever sing for joy.
Spread your protection over them,
    that those who love your name may rejoice in you.

Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous;
you surround them with your favor as with a shield.

                                        - Psalms 5:1-3, 11-12
```

### Exegesis

One of the key things to note about this passage is when the Psalmist chooses to lay his requests before God â€“ the morning. If you wake up and the very first thing you do is cry and lament before God, then this illustrates a point of extreme stress. The object of stress in this Psalm is enough to haunt the writer's every waking moment. It causes enough concern for the Psalmist to wait on God to answer the writer.

Yet, what may or may not be implied from this is that the Psalmist still chooses rest and/or sleep. In verses 11 - 12, the Psalmist knows that God protects and blesses those who love Him and he chooses to have faith and trust in that knowledge to rest and rejoice.
