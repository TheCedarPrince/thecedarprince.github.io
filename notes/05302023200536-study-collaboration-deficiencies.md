### Motivation

Although I believe strongly network studies are a good idea, it is also worth countering my intuition to know about what are the deficiencies that can be found in network studies. These are some notes on those deficiences.

### Overarching Themes

  * Social Determinants of Health information is not well represented within a observational health network study
  * Concept sets used in the creation of a cohort definition need to be handled with care

      * Must be thought of holistically
      * Susceptible to biasing overall study
