### Reading Motivation

I read this paper to find out more about the social vulnerability index and how it can be used in the state of Georgia. It wasn't particularly insightful although the discussion about calculating SVI for GA and its definition about social vulnerability was helpful.

### Definitions

Social vulnerability is defined as the extent to which a community contains social characteristics that may affect the community's overall resilience (18). It is affected by 	- Situational factors: Employment, Education, Income, Housing Type (19, 20) 	- Intrinsic factors: Age, Race, and Ethnicity (19, 21)

### Social Vulnerability Index Calculations

### Digression on Black Belt

I never knew the term for this but historically, where African Americans were heavily enslaved is called the "Black Belt". The authors found that high SVI and heat-related deaths were often found in these historical communities [32].
