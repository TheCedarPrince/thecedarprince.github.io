### Definitions

  * Telehealth - remote healthcare delivery via telecommunication tools with or without video

### Goals of Telehealth

```

### Current Issues with Care

  * Booking a 20 minute physician appointment takes an average of 20 days [1]
  * Traveling to an appointment and waiting often takes nearly 2 hours [2]

### Opportunities for Telehealth

  * Chronic condition patients

```
- Elderly Americans 
	- ~2 million elderly that are homebound [3]
	- Medical home will be patient's home for best patient-centered care [4]
```

  * Acute care patients

```
- Stroke [5]
- Pneumonia [6]
```

### Challenges to Telehealth

  * Reimbursement issues

```
- Eligible for clinical facilities where shortage of health professionals (get citation)
```

  * Lack of socialization

```
- The digital divide [7]
	- Difference of access to telehealth based on:
		- Geography 
		- Social factors
