### Reading Motivation

I wanted to learn Lua for no other reason than to program my own workflow in neovim. Also, Lua is cool and Just-in-Time compiled like Julia! Plus, it is used for game development so if ever this research thing doesn't work out, backup plan: become a game developer.

### Comments

How to write comments within Lua!

```lua
-- This is my comment! 

--[[ 
	This
	is 
	a 
	multiline 
	comment! 
--]]
```

### Variable Scope

#### Global Scope

All variables within lua are considered global by default. Moreover, each call or line within a lua script is run as a chunk.

```lua
Var = 10
print( "Global var:", Var )
```

#### Local Scope

To define a large chunk where variables are local in scope, one can create a local scope using a do-end block 

```lua
do
	local Var = 20
	print( "Local Var:", Var )
end
```

### Variable Assignments

```lua
A = A + 1 -- This works 
A += 1 -- This does not work 

B = 0 -- This works
C = 0 -- This works
B, C = 0, 0 -- This works
B = C = 0 -- This does not work
```

### Variable Types

There are eight basic types within Lua: 

  * `nil` - represents absence of data
  * `boolean`
  * `number` - `integer` and `float` both exist as alternative subtypes of `number`
  * `string`
  * `userdata`
  * `function`
  * `thread`
  * `table`

```lua
print( type("Hello") ) -- string 
print( type(10.4 * 3) ) -- number 
print( type({1, 2, 3}) ) -- table
print( type(print) ) -- function 
print( type(true) ) -- boolean 
print( type(nil) ) -- nil
```

> NOTE: Arithmetic operations applied to an object of type `string` will not fail but instead Lua will attempt to convert that object to a `number` type.  Vice-versa to this is that if a object of type `number` is used in a `string` operation, Lua will attempt to convert that object to a `string`.


### Math Operators

```lua
A = 100
B = 2 

print( A + B ) -- Addition
print( A - B ) -- Subtraction 
print( A * B ) -- Multiplication
print( A ^ B ) -- Exponents 
print( A / B ) -- Division
print( A // B ) -- Floor
print( A % B ) -- Modulus
print( -A ) -- Negation
```

### Relational Operators

```lua
A = 20
B = 4

print(A == B) -- false
print(A ~= B) -- true
print(A > B) -- true
print(A < B) -- false
print(A >= B) -- true
print(A <= B) -- false
```

### Logical Operators

```lua
print(true and 10) -- evaluates to `10`
print(10 and true) -- evaluates `true`
print(false and 10) -- short circuits to `false`
print(false or 10) -- evaluates to `10`
print(nil and 10) -- evaluates to `nil`
print(nil or 10) -- evaluates to `10`
print(false and nil) -- evaluates to `false`
print(false and not(nil)) -- evaluates to `false`
```
