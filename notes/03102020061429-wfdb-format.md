### Overview

The Waveform Database (WFDB) Library is a record management system to handle already existing databases - it itself is not a database but a collection of tools to handle databases that follow the WFDB format. [1] Furthermore, WFDB can be used for viewing, analyzing, and creating recordings of physiological signals [2].

### How It Works

The way that the WFDB record format works is that it utilizes [pg 1, @moodyWFDBProgrammerGuide2019]:

  * **Header Files** to specify the characteristics of a signal (sampling frequency, etc.)
  * **Annotation Files** to record annotations corresponding to a signal (generally kept in time with the rest of the signal)

### Example Application - ECG Data

For example, when working with ECG data, the format utilizes the header and annotation files as follows [pg 2 - 3, @moodyWFDBProgrammerGuide2019]:

  * **Header Files** - could contain information about lead count, calibration format, etc.
  * **Annotation Files** - could contain other information such as beat positions.

### Miscellaneous Notes

  * WFDB is considered a standard data format within the research world, and has found application in industry as well.
  * The WFDB format is generally used for ECG records - however, it can extend to other data formats.
  * A possible alternative to the WFDB record format is the European Data Format+ (EDF+) [see @garciamartinezLoadingPlottingFiltering2017 for more information].
