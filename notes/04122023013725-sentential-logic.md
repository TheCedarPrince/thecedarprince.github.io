#### Not Sure Section

Theorem 1.4.7. For any sets A and B, (A ∪ B) \ B ⊆ A. Proof. We must show that if something is an element of (A ∪ B) \ B, then it must also be an element of A, so suppose that x ∈ (A ∪ B) \ B. This means that x ∈ A ∪ B and x ∈ B, or in other words x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B and x ∈ B. But notice that these statements have the logical form P ∨ Q and ¬Q, and this is precisely the form of the premises of our very first example of a deductive argument in Section 1.1! As we saw in that example, from these premises we can conclude that x ∈ A must be true. Thus, anything that is an element of (A ∪ B) \ B must also be an element of A, so (A ∪ B) \ B ⊆ A.
