### Overview

In the monthly plan, one should use this as a big picture preview of the upcoming month and each day you should only have one item about the biggest event for that day. Keep it short and concise!!!

### Monthly Breakdown

Each day is logged here; furthermore, the following can be recorded:

1. Goals for the month
2. Major upcoming tasks for the month
3. Habits (good to break it down as a daily chart of sorts)

Choose what works for you and continue with it; with the major upcoming tasks, I would suggest putting that in your monthly log.

#### Habit Tracker
