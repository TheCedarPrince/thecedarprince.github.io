The Leitner system uses flashcards to implement a spaced repetition learning system. It was created by German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s.

> Successfully recalled cards are moved to the next group. Unsuccessfully recalled cards go back to the first box.


Using the Leitner system, learners create flashcards with discrete facts on them. These cards are grouped based on how well a learner knows the information on the card. They are arranged via the following method:

  * If a card is successfully recalled, the card is put into the next group.
  * If a card is not successfully recalled it is sent to the first group.

The cards are kept in a box and are partitioned by spacings in the box. The size of each participation determined when cards were to be reviewed. For Leitner's implementation, this consisted of 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14cm partition sizes. Reviews only took place when a partition is filled to proper sizing.

In Leitner's original method, published in his book So lernt man Lerne (How to learn to learn), the schedule of repetition was governed by the size of the partitions in the learning box.
