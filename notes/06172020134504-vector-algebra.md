There are a few [definitions of a vector](/05132020135855-linear-vectors.md). For this overview, I will use the definition that a vector is that which has the algebra of a vector space. The operations for vectors are straight-forward:

1. Vector Addition

$$
v + w = \begin{bmatrix} v_{1}\\ v_{2} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} w_{1}\\ w_{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_{1} + w_{1}\\ v_{2} + w_{2} \end{bmatrix}
$$

2. Scalar Multiplication

$$
2v = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
2v_{1} \\
2v_{2} \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$
