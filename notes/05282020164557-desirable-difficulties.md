Performance is a quantifiable metric that is observed in teaching or practice.

Performance is not a valid metric to determine if learning is occuring.

Storage strength defines how interassociated a representation of memory is to relevant experiences (such as knowledge or skills).

Learning is the idea of creating permanent changes in one's understanding or knowledge regarding a particular subject.

Factors that quickly improve retrieval strength are different from those that improve storage strength. If learners mistake retrieval strength as storage strength, a learner could mistakenly be led to believe that situations which improve retrieval strength could improve storage strength.
