The term *EDA* is often used synonymously in academic literature to refer to its usage as a non-invasive biomarker to investigate physiological arousal. EDA is generally recorded using two small electrodes and are usually [1], [2] can be placed on the:

  * Fingers
  * Palms
  * Feet

These electrodes complete a circuit across the skin – the skin acts as a variable resistor – and then [measure changes in skin conductance](/03242020003215-eda-explained.md) (see note for more information on what variables EDA monitors). After the EDA signal is collected from the electrodes, the signal is typically (by convention) decomposed into skin conductance level [SCL](/04092020161622-skin-conductance.md) and skin conductance responses [SCR](/04092020162632-skin-response.md) (click links to see definitions of both).
