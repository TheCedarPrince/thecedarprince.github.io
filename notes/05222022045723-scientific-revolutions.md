### "Scientific Revolutions" and the Term "Revolution"

According to Kuhn, these crises are the requirements for a new paradigm to come forth. This leads to extraordinary science as this episode in a paradigm's life is extraordinary that causes a basic shift in how science is even conducted. This period, coined by Kuhn, is called a "Scientific Revolution".

Kuhn was very particular in invoking the term "revolution". He related the phrase "scientific revolution" analogously to a political revolution. In the same way that a political revolution is often fomented when a political body fails to serve adequately the growing body of its populace, so too are the grounds set for a scientific revolution.

Although a paradigm may shift how one does science, the world itself does not change. Rather, the way we view and operate in the world does. For the adoptees of a new paradigm, the adoptee must say something to the effect of "I once understood X to be Y, but I was mistaken" and in doing so admit a form of error in looking at reality.
