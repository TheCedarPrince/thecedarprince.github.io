1. "Principle of Atomicity" – each zettel should contain only one idea (principle credited to Christian Tietze).
2. Each zettel should be self-contained and understandable as a standalone scrap of thought.
3. Link each zettel and explain why you are linking them together.
4. Reword gathered information in your own words (unless if it is a verbatim quote or something).
5. Add references to each zettel.
6. Don't be afraid to add your own ideas to the Zettelkasten – embrace it.
7. Have no fear when it comes to organization – the order will arise organically in the Zettelkasten.
8. Never delete a zettel and don't worry too much about when you create zettels; the more information the better.
9. Don't overthink the Zettelkasten. Keep it simple and efficient.
