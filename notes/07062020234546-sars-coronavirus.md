SARS-CoV does not act like the other coronaviruses. It's classification is debated by researchers but some put it in group 2. [1]

Phase I of initial showing of SARS-CoV symptoms [1]:

1. Fever > 38°C
2. Rigors
3. Myalgia
4. Sore throat
5. Gastrointestinal symptoms

Phase 2 (3 - 7 days after initial symptoms) Characterized by cough and shortness of breath. Hypoxia can develop in individuals and relative lymphopenia and neutropenia is possible. [1]

Some patients showed a biphasic course, with apparent recovery followed by worsening of the clinical condition. Mortality was highest in the elderly and lowest in the younger population, and co-existing illness worsened morbidity and mortality. Upwards of 10 - 20% of cases needed ventilation. [1]
