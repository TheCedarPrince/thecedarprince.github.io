I read a Q&A article on Barbara Liskov [1] and the author made a very interesting comparison between Liskov's work of designing paradigms for creating well structured and crafted code with that of a Poet or Novelist. I have heard of comparisons like this before but I was quite intrigued by the latter – a programmer being compared to a writer. What piqued my interest the most about the article was the following statement,

"As a computer scientist thinking about code, Liskov had no physical objects to work with. Like a novelist or a poet, *she was staring at a blank page*." (emphasis added)

The end of that statement, "*blank page*", reminded me of the book *How to Take Smart Notes* [2] and my note on the book where Ahrens essentially believes that starting with a [blank page is the wrong idea in writing](https://jacobzelko.com/03292020180520-smart-notes). I wonder if the same could be true about programming. In effect, does a global approach to building software make more sense than to artificially package each and every piece of software separately? Could an approach like the [Zettelkasten method](https://jacobzelko.com/03092020031549-zettelkasten) where, according to its [principles](https://jacobzelko.com/03092020031618-zettelkasten-principles), each thought is kept to itself and then linked to different associated pieces of knowledge, map to software development?

Upon reflection upon this note some time later, I think I was thinking about the concept of composition and composition of software!
