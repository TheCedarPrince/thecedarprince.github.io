### Motivation

I wanted to more clearly define and delineate how OHDSI suggests a protocol design.

### General Details

A study's plan should be well-documented prior to executing a study.

### Outline of What a Protocol Should Include

  * Primary study question
  * Approach to answer study question
  * Study population(s):

      * Well-defined
      * Should be able to be reproduced by others
  * Methods such as:

      * Statistical procedures
  * Expected study results:

      * Metrics that are used to answer the question
      * Tables
      * Plots
  * Pre-Study Assessment

      * Feasibility assessment
      * Statistical power of a study
  * Anticipated time line
  * Study Milestones
