**Indirect self-harm** (ISH) are non-suicidal actions that individuals take to physically mistreat or abuse themselves. It does not immediately lead to direct bodily damage [1]. Examples of ISH are eating disorders, remaining in physically abusive relationships, extended abuse of substances, and flippant behavior [1].

Indirect self-harm (ISH) is conceptually different from [direct self-harm](/07122020185239-direct-self-harm.md) (DSH). Generally, ISH is an expression of centering oneself. It is a way to control one's feelings or to exact punishment. [2] As such, ISH can be a coping mechanism to handle emotional anguish, rage and frustration. [1] Some use it as a means to lower tension [3].

Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses. [4] For women aged 15-24, mortality rates related to Anorexia are 12 times greater than other mortality rates. [5] As such, the eating disorder community is generally the most prolific indirect self-harm community. A majority of the literature about  indirect self-harm literature is centered around it [6]–[9]
