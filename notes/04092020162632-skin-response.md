Skin conductance response (SCR) are the fast portions found in the decomposition of the EDA signal. They are then superimposed onto the [Skin Conductance Level](/04092020161622-skin-conductance.md) (click link to see what the SCL is).

Conventionally [1]–[3], SCR is classified via the following criterion:

  * An increase in EDA of at least $0.05\mu S$ over a period of $1 - 3$ seconds
  * Immediately after this increase, there should be seen a gradual decrease in EDA over $3 - 15$ seconds to what value (or *level*) was recorded before the SCR event
