### Motivation

I wanted to have a consistent resource about where to publish materials for research and other publication artifacts. This is a short list that takes inspiration from multiple different influences in my life such as Dr. Gari Clifford, Dr. Jon Duke, Dr. John Carlos Baez, and others who had identified such meaningful lists of resources.
