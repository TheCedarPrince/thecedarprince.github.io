Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) is a lifelong disability that manifests before age 18. It imposes limits on areas of learning, language, and behavior. [1]

An estimated 2.6 - 4 million people with intellectual and developmental disabilities reside in US community settings. [2], [3] *RQ: I wonder if this includes autistic individuals*
