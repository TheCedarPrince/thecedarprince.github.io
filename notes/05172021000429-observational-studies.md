### Prior to Research Studies

Before beginning an observational research study, it is important to lay down a rigorous and robust framework for how the study is to be conducted. This keeps questioning on a guided path that leads to direct and actionable results. [1]

1. Study population ought be explained to where others could reproduce it.
