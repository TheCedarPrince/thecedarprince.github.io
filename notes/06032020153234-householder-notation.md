Householder notation is very simple:

1. Scalars are denoted as lowercase Greek letters: $\alpha$. $\beta$, $\gamma$, ...
2. Vectors are represented as lowercase English letters: $a$, $b$, $c$, ...
3. Matrices are denoted as uppercase English letters: $A$, $B$, $C$, ...
4. Vector transposes are denoted with the apostrophe ( ' )
5. Vector or matrix multiplication uses the star character ( * )

### Examples

1. The inner product can be expressed as $u' * v = \alpha$ (i.e. a transposed vector times a vector yields a scalar)
2. The outer product can be expressed similarly as $u * v' = A$ (i.e. a vector times a transposed vector yields a matrix)
3. Quadratic/bilinear forms can be written as $u' * A * v = \beta$ (i.e. a transposed vector times a matrix times a vector yields a scalar)
