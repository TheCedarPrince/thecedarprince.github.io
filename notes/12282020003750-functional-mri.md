Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) finds levels of electrical brain activity.Great at determining where brain activity is. [1] fMRI imaging was used to show activation patterns in spatially separated, though in-sync, [brain region activity](/12282020003106-dynamic-functional-connectivity.md). It has become clear there is a spatial and temporal periodicity in the brain that probably reflects some of the constant processes of the brain.
