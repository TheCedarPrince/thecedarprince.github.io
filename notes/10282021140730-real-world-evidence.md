### Background

Real-World Evidence, according to Congress, is any data that concerns the use, benefits, or risks of a drug from nontraditional sources (i.e. clinical trials)

### United States Food and Drug Administration Definitions

The United States Food and Drug Administration found this definition from Congress to be too expansive and vague. For their purposes, they limited the language further to make the definitions less vague. Here they are:

  * **Real-world data** "relates to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources."

Some examples include:

```
- Electronic health records
- Claims and billing activities
- Product and disease registries 
- Patient-generated data including in home-use settings 
- Mobile device data
```

  * **Real-world evidence** is "clinical evidence regarding the usage and potential benefits or risks of a medical product derived from analysis of real-world evidence."

Some examples include:

```
- Randomized trials 
	- Large simple trials
	- Pragmatic trials
	- Observational studies (prospective and/or retrospective).
```
