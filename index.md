### My Name Is Jacob S. Zelko -- Welcome to _the cedar ledge_! :wave:

I am a graduate of [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.bme.gatech.edu/) with a BS in biomedical engineering.
I currently work at [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://gtri.gatech.edu/) in the Health Emerging and Advanced Technologies division (HEAT-D) as a Health Data Analytics and Informatics Researcher as well as being a Contractor for the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/).

### What Am I Passionate About? :nerd_face:

<!--TODO: Rewrite this section-->

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the social determinants of health, resource constrained environments, neurocognitive disabilities, mental health, equitable healthcare, reproducible science, open source science, knowledge management, and education.
Additionally, as a [practicing Christian](05072022162026-personal-faith-perspectives.md), I am very interested in the intersection of faith communities and science.
More technically, I develop open source scientific software using Julia and Python to analyze medical datasets to produce performant analysis pipelines and visualization schemes.
I use my [blog](/blog) to share on my thoughts on anything ranging from programming and knowledge management to academia and best practices.

<!--TODO: Address Projects page-->
For information about ongoing projects, please visit my [Projects](/projects/) page.

### How To Navigate _the cedar ledge_? :computer:

<!--TODO: Add in this section-->

### Any Hobbies? :guitar:

<!--TODO: Update this-->

I am a multi-instrumentalist; I am heavily influenced by acts like Caspian and Hammock and composers such as Ólafur Arnalds and Jóhann Jóhannsson.
A short film I scored was even nominated for the [Cannes Short Film Corner](/projects/2018-09-20-Its Different/) at the Cannes festival!

I also host an [educational Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince) where I work on open source coding and research projects.
I use this outlet to teach best practices in software engineering, how to program, and development workflows.

Also, for fun, I am trying to pick up Stenography to write quicker using a hobbyist stenography machine. :keyboard:
