# Hello! | ¡Hola! | Hallo! | !مرحبا -- Welcome to _the cedar ledge_! :wave:

My name is Jacob Scott Zelko!
I am currently pursuing my MS in Applied Mathematics at Northeastern University (NEU) and am a trainee of [NEU's Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu).
Additionally, I am the present Chief of Global Health Informatics at the [Brooklyn-based non-profit, the OneFact Foundation](https://www.onefact.org).

My research career has focused primarily and broadly on population health.
In particular, [chronic mental illness (i.e. depression, suicidality, and bipolar disorder)](https://jacobzelko.com/01052023041609-pilot-study-characterization/), social determinants of health and [health disparities within intersectional populations](https://jacobzelko.com/01102023212115-computable-phenotypes/), chronic illness, and neurocognitive disabilities.
As a convergence of my interests, I am very interested in how we can use mathematical structures (such as categories or topologies) to establish meaningful relationships between non-traditional health data sources to gain greater insights into population health.
To bridge these worlds, I have been heavily involved with observational health research methods using ["Real World Data"](https://jacobzelko.com/10282021140730-real-world-evidence/) and am an active member of both [the OHDSI ](https://www.ohdsi.org) and [Category Theory](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/category-theory-community-server/) communities.

Finally, I do have vested interests in what I call my "lower priority" research interests.
This includes things such as open and reproducible science, [knowledge representation](https://jacobzelko.com/04172022033744-open-knowledge-standard/) and [knowledge management](https://jacobzelko.com/NoteMate/dev/), [diversity and inclusion efforts within STEAM](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/CommunityFund), domestic extremism (within US contexts), and as a [practicing Christian](05072022162026-personal-faith-perspectives), the intersection of faith communities and science.

In the past, I worked for a couple years at [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://gtri.gatech.edu/) in the excellent HEAT Division as a Health Data Analytics and Informatics Researcher headed by [Dr. Jon Duke](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/jon-duke) and as a Research Engineer for the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/).
While in my undergrad, I also worked at [Emory University's Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html) as a Data Information Specialist.
I graduated [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.bme.gatech.edu/) with a BS in Biomedical Engineering [also completed coursework in biomedical informatics and medical anthropology] and completed an AS in Engineering Science at [Corning Community College](https://www.corning-cc.edu/academics/engineering-science/index.php).

# What about Fun Stuff Like Hobbies? :guitar:

These days, I greatly enjoy working out regularly -- weights, running, and free-body!
I love reading and have been on a bit of a philosophy kick reading the works of [Feyerabend](https://jacobzelko.com/07122020043224-against-method/), [Kierkegaard](https://jacobzelko.com/11202022210340-fear-trembling/), and [MacLuhan](https://jacobzelko.com/05222022225241-understanding-media-extensions/) -- these certainly take some time to read!
Otherwise, as the leader of the [JuliaHealth workgroup](https://juliahealth.org), I am trying to think through how to continue building open source tools for health informatics research -- let me know if you want to collaborate!
Additionally, I am a [Twitch streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince) and teach software engineering, programming, and development patterns.
Finally, my more eclectic and smaller hobbies include blogging, electric and acoustic guitar, traveling, and hanging out with friends over a cuppa tea.
