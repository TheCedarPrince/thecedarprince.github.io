### About Me, Jacob S. Zelko -- welcome to _the cedar ledge_! :wave:

<!--TODO: Update my CV - convert to Markdown with pandoc filter?-->
<!--TODO: Add CV page-->
Visit this [link to see my CV :page_facing_up:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ypAm8i6eYd7cZfFolItf4Q6B08459VwP/view?usp=sharing)

My name is Jacob S. Zelko!
I graduated [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.bme.gatech.edu/) with a BS in biomedical engineering.
I work at [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://gtri.gatech.edu/) in the HEAT Division as a researcher and am a Contractor for the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/).

My research career has focused on mental health -- in particular, examining bipolar disorder, depression, and suicidality.
This focus has led me to studying about the social determinants of health, neurocognitive disabilities, and health equity.
Additionally, I have vested interests in observational health research and am an [active member of OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org), open and reproducible science, knowledge management, science education, and as a [practicing Christian](05072022162026-personal-faith-perspectives), the intersection of faith communities and science.

### What about Fun Stuff Like Hobbies? :guitar:

In terms of hobbies, I study Category Theory with the [AlgebraicJulia community](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/) and record my learnings on [Crash Course Category Theory (C3T)](https://jacobzelko.com/C3T/).
In the open source world, I am the co-creator of [JuliaAnimators](https://github.com/JuliaAnimators) and the animation engine, [Javis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAnimators/Javis.jl), and stream its development on my [educational Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince) to teach software engineering, programming, and development patterns.
Finally, my more eclectic and smaller hobbies include reading, writing, electric and acoustic guitar, stenography, running, and traveling.
