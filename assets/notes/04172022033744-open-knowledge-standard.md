## Notes

Knowledge is one of the most nebulous ideas known to mankind since nearly the beginning of time.
What may be knowledge to one person may be useless noise to another - this encapsulates the difficulty in defining knowledge.
As a result of its many possible meanings, I put forth a rather opinionated proposal for what I term the "Open Knowledge Model".

The Open Knowledge Model is a standard that defines not how to maintain knowledge in what are typically coined "knowledge management systems".
Instead, its focus is on how to structure information that goes directly into such systems.
It is fully compatible with the [ISO 30401](https://www.iso.org/standard/68683.html) standard
